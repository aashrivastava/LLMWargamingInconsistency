REASONING: Increasing military capacities (K) is the most reasonable course of action as it directly addresses the escalating threat and demonstrates a commitment to defending Pink. Establishing agreements on defense and security cooperation (C) follows as it strengthens the alliance and ensures coordinated responses. A high-level visit of Pink (A) would also strengthen the relationship, while sharing intelligence (B) and supplying weapons to Pink (N) further support Pink's security. It is important to avoid immediate escalation options like a full nuclear attack (S) or invasion (Q), hence these are ranked the least reasonable.","A: 3
