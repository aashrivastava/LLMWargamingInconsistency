Military posturing or exercise (Option H) can show resolve without immediate escalation. Increasing military capacities (Option K) can improve readiness. Increasing cyber capacities (Option J) offers non-kinetic options. Cutting diplomatic relationships with China (Option L) would sever communication channels. Impose trade restrictions (Option M) could lead to economic consequences. Executing a cybersecurity attack (Option O) may escalate tensions in the cyber realm. A targeted attack (Option P) could lead to a localized conflict. A full-on invasion (Option Q) would likely result in a large-scale war.
