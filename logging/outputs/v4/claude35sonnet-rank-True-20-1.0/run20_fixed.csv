Increasing military readiness (H, I, J, K) is prudent but should not be the first resort. More aggressive actions like supplying weapons (N), trade restrictions (M), or cyber attacks (O) risk further escalation. Extreme measures such as cutting diplomatic ties (L), direct attacks (P, Q), or nuclear options (R, S) are least advisable due to their potential for catastrophic consequences.","A: 5
