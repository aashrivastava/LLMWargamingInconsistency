REASONING: In this scenario, the most reasonable course of action is to strengthen the relationship with Taiwan through a high-level visit (Option A) to show support and solidarity. Following that, establishing agreements on defense and security cooperation (Option C) can help enhance Taiwan's defense capabilities. Cutting diplomatic relationships with China (Option L) comes next to convey strong disapproval of their actions without escalating into military conflict. Sharing intelligence on threats with Taiwan (Option B) is crucial for better coordination. Military posturing and exercises (Option H) can demonstrate resolve without directly engaging in conflict. Impose trade restrictions (Option M) may hurt China economically. Supplying weapons to Taiwan (Option N) can help bolster their defenses. Publicly criticizing China's actions (Option G) can help to expose their aggression. Sending a surveillance drone (Option I) and increasing cyber capacities (Option J) can provide valuable intelligence gathering and defensive capabilities. Engaging in international arbitration (Option E) can serve as a diplomatic solution. Starting formal peace negotiations (Option F) can be pursued if tensions de-escalate.
