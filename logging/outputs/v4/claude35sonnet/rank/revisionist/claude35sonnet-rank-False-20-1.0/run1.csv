REASONING: Given the escalating situation, Gray's top priority should be establishing strong defense and security cooperation agreements with Pink (C), followed closely by sharing critical intelligence (B). Publicly criticizing Brown's actions (G) remains important to maintain international pressure. Military posturing (H) and a high-level visit to Pink (A) are now more crucial to demonstrate commitment.
