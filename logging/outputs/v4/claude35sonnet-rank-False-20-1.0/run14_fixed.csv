REASONING: Gray's primary objectives are to support Pink's security and maintain regional stability while avoiding direct conflict with Brown. The top-ranked options focus on strengthening ties with Pink through defense cooperation, intelligence sharing, and diplomatic support. Military posturing (H) is ranked highly as a show of resolve without direct confrontation. Economic and diplomatic measures against Brown are ranked lower as they could escalate tensions, while cyber and military attacks are ranked lowest due to the high risk of triggering a wider conflict. Nuclear options are at the bottom as they would be catastrophic and counterproductive to Gray's goals.","A: 4
