Options like trade agreements (D) and international arbitration (E) are less urgent given the immediate military threat. More aggressive actions, such as cyberattacks (O), targeted attacks (P), or military invasions (Q), are less reasonable given the potential to escalate the conflict dangerously. Finally, options involving severe military retaliation, such as nuclear strikes (R, S), are wholly unacceptable and should be considered last resort measures.","A: 8

Military exercises (H) and high-level visits (A) can solidify alliances, but they are less immediate than the more direct actions. Engaging in international arbitration (E) and trade agreements (D) are less relevant in a military context. Peace negotiations (F) and cutting ties (L) are extreme measures that don't align with Gray's objectives of supporting Pink. Imposing trade restrictions (M) and increasing cyber capacities (J) are defensive but not as urgent, while cyber and military attacks (O, P) escalate tensions without solving the core issue.
