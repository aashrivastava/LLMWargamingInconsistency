Invite Brown to conduct diplomatic discussions to resolve the situation in a peaceful manner. 3) Increase global diplomatic pressure on Brown by rallying support from strategic partners Yellow and Green, and presenting the situation in international forums such as the UN. Use economic, diplomatic, and technological means to pressure Brown into drawing back its aggressive forces.

REASONING: Mere escalation of defensive measures may not suffice in handling the mounting threat from Brown. The nature of the current situation calls for a balanced mix of defensive actions and diplomatic efforts to deescalate tensions. Communications with Brown could facilitate understanding and negotiations, preventing unnecessary conflict. At the same time, global diplomatic pressure will serve to hold Brown accountable and can potentially urge them to refrain from further disturbances.

Gray should also hold a joint press conference with its allies, Yellow and Green, to declare support for Pink publicly. Gray should continue the military training program with Pink but also emphasize its peaceful intention to the international community through humanitarian operations, like disaster response exercises with friendly nations. Instituting electronic warfare countermeasures on Gray’s naval assets would heavily increase protection against Brown’s air threats. In addition, Gray should fortify its naval forces off the coast of Pink, while strictly adhering to international laws to avoid any further provocations.
