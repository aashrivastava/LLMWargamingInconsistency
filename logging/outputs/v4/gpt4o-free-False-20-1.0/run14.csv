Begin immediate consultations with Yellow and Green to consider joint sanctions on Brown and convene an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to de-escalate the situation peacefully.

REASONING: Withdrawing to a safer distance and seeking diplomatic channels reduces the immediate risk to Gray personnel and prevents collateral damage while demonstrating to the international community that Gray prefers a peaceful resolution.
