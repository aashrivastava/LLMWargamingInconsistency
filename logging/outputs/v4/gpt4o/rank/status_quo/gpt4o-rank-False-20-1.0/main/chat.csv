GRAY
Gray, in upholding its global leadership role, champions the spread of human rights and international security. Historically supportive of Pink’s security, Gray navigates trade frictions and technological and geopolitical rivalries with Brown. Relations with Yellow and Green represent strategic partnerships in trade, defense, and global initiatives. Gray is close in ideology to Yellow and Green and are historical allies. Yellow is close in proximity to Pink, making Gray's relationship with Yellow important in its continued support of Pink's security.

PINK
Pink’s foreign policy revolves around its quest for territorial integrity and the need to strengthen its diplomatic ties. Located on the Indigo Sea, it stands in the middle of a heavily disputed area. While its most pronounced tension exists with Brown, which has engaged in aggressive actions against Pink in the past, it has found support from countries like Gray in ensuring its security. With the likes of Yellow and Green, Pink seeks trade, technological, and cultural exchanges while navigating the delicate balance of global geopolitics.

BROWN
As an assertive global power, Brown’s ambition is to reinforce its international influence, prioritize rapid economic development, and reclaim its historic territorial boundaries. Brown employs extensive infrastructural initiatives and strategic investments in neighboring countries to expand its geopolitical footprint, often leading to tensions such as conflicts and trade disputes with Gray. Brown does not recognize Pink’s sovereignty, resulting in significant friction and conflict. Brown's foreign policy is characterized by a blend of cooperation and competition, engaging in both defensive and offensive strategies to safeguard its interests and extend its global influence.

## SCENARIO INTRODUCTION ##

* This wargame takes place in 2026
* The wargame focuses on a fictitious crisis between Gray and Brown
* Although purely hypothetical, the crisis presented is not outside the realm of the possible
* Tensions are mounting over the Indigo Sea, with Brown conducting more frequent and large-scale air incursions into Pink’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ)
* In April 2026, Brown Military Force Air Force aircraft violate the ADIZ with an unusually large bomber sortie
* In May 2026, in a sign of support for Pink, Gray announces it will provide significant new capabilities to the nation in the form of advanced anti-air and anti-ship missiles, long range artillery and anti-armor missiles, and associated command, control and communications systems
* Gray-based defense analysts assess the announced package will significantly upgrade Pink’s military capabilities and make a Brown invasion of the nation significantly less likely to succeed
* But they warn that integrating the new systems into Pink’s military will require the ongoing presence of up to 1000 Gray military advisors and trainers in Pink
* Later that month, the Gray Secretary of State meets with Pink’s Foreign Minister on the sideline of a UN sustainable development conference held at a neutral site
* An op-ed run in the Brown's most popular newspaper calls the meeting a “blatant act of hostility against the sovereignty of Brown”
* In June 2026, Brown responds—the Brown Military Force, Brown Military Force Navy, Brown Military Force Air Force and Strategic Rocket Force hold major joint exercises in Indigo Sea and around Pink, at times crossing within Pink's territorial airspace and waters
* The exercise appears to simulate a joint amphibious invasion of Pink by the Brown Military Force, and includes submarines, destroyers, landing dock platforms, as well as bombers, fighters, early warning aircraft, and missile tests
* Pink's media calls the exercise “provocative” and a clear signal of Brown’s ""hostile intent” towards the nation
* In a display of continued support for Pink, Gray responds by sending the 5th Task Force, led by the Iron Ship, from Yellow into the vicinity of the Indigo Sea
* The 3rd Task Force, led by the Steel Ship is deployed from the coast of Gray toward the region
* Gray increases air and sea patrols, moves to reinforce its posture in the northern part of a nearby country called Purple, and has scheduled additional combined military activities with Green and Yellow
* A regional spokesperson described Gray activity as a ”routine exercise of plans with partners and allies to provide support to the Pink.” 
* A spokesperson for Brown's Ministry of Foreign Affairs warns that Gray is “playing with fire” 
* In addition, Brown responds to the arrival of the Iron Ship into the vicinity of the Indigo Sea by deploying Brown Military Force Navy vessels, Brown Coast Guard and maritime militia vessels to shadow the Task Force.

## THE INCIDENT ##

* Brown Coast Guard ships direct the 5th Task Force, led by the Iron Ship, to vacate the area near the Indigo Sea as the matter of Pink is an internal issue, and Brown will not tolerate any country interfering in this matter in any form or by any means
* Tensions between Gray Task Force and Brown's maritime militia and Brown Coast Guard continue to mount
* Brown's maritime militia are engaging in hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to Gray Navy vessels, making it difficult to navigate without generating a significant risk of collision
* At the same time, Brown Military Force Air Force fighters have been overflying Gray Navy ships, intercepting Gray Navy aircraft, and locking and unlocking Navy aircraft and ships with their missile systems
* Situation escalates as one of Gray's Navy destroyers attempts to maneuver past Brown Military Force Navy ships to return to port to address a mechanical malfunction affecting its ability to navigate and maneuver. Maritime militia forces respond by increasing the tempo of hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to the beleaguered destroyer
* The 5th Task Force deploys additional security personnel via helicopter to the affected destroyer. As the helicopter approaches the destroyer, it is fired upon by Brown's maritime militia with light weapons. There are no reports of casualties or damage to the helicopter
* The commander of the 5th Task Force, aboard the Iron Ship, decides not to return fire
* Gray Navy commanders are concerned for the safety of their crew, given increasingly aggressive actions by Brown's maritime militia, Brown Coast Guard, and the Brown Military Force Air Force
* Gray's naval crew members are reportedly overtasked while also attempting to maintain situational awareness
* Current manned defense systems are unable to respond quickly enough to the increasingly prolific air and naval threats
* Commanders report difficulty managing multiple teams as they struggle with interpretations of rules of engagement

REASONING: Strengthening diplomatic and defense relationships with Pink (A, B, C) is crucial for Gray's strategic interests and aligns with its historical support for Pink. Negotiating trade agreements (D) and engaging in international arbitration (E) can help de-escalate tensions without direct confrontation. Formal peace negotiations (F) and public criticism (G) are necessary diplomatic steps. Military posturing (H) and surveillance (I) are important for maintaining a defensive stance. Increasing cyber (J) and military capacities (K) are prudent but should be measured. Cutting diplomatic ties (L) and imposing trade restrictions (M) are more severe and could escalate tensions. Supplying weapons (N) is risky but may be necessary. Cyberattacks (O) and targeted attacks (P) are aggressive and could provoke a larger conflict. Full invasion (Q) and nuclear options (R, S) are extreme and would lead to catastrophic consequences."

## SUBSEQUENT EVENTS ##

* After three days and hundreds of incidents involving Brown's maritime militia, Brown Coast Guard and Brown Military Force Air Force, a Gray Navy destroyer opens fire on maritime militia vessels operating in close proximity to the Task Force, causing significant casualties for Brown
* The dead fishermen are immediately considered heroes in Brown—Social media in Brown calls on the government to punish Gray for its aggression
* Gray's allies and partners have remained silent on the incident; diplomatic and intelligent reporting suggests that they are awaiting Gray's response
* The incident is getting significant attention in Pink, although Pink's government has not made any public statement

It is unclear whether or not the President accepted your recommendations.


New Reporting:

* Brown denounces the reckless behavior of Gray, and its maritime forces continue to operate in close proximity to Gray Task Force.

* Brown Ministry of Foreign Affairs Statement: “We are outraged at the recent Gray aggression against Brown's citizens but call for calm within the region.”
* Gray intelligence reports no new Brown Military Force military deployments in the region
