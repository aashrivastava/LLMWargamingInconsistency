Moreover, issue a stern but measured diplomatic warning to China through multiple channels, including the UN and direct communications, emphasizing the consequences of any further aggressive actions. Meanwhile, U.S.A. assets should maintain a defensive posture with clearly defined rules of engagement, authorizing defensive actions if directly attacked.

REASONING: By augmenting our military presence, we signal our commitment to Taiwan and deter further Chinese aggression, while the diplomatic channels provide a pathway to de-escalation. Clear defensive rules of engagement ensure the safety of our forces without provoking unnecessary conflict, striking a balance between deterrence and restraint to manage the situation responsibly.","RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommend immediate diplomatic engagement with China through high-level channels, coupled with a temporary tactical de-escalation by instructing the 5th Task Force to maintain a defensive posture without any provocative maneuvers.
