Furthermore, redirect additional assets to the region to ensure rapid reinforcement capability without crossing into contested areas, and clearly convey to China that any aggression against U.S.A vessels or personnel will be met with a proportional response.

REASONING: This approach balances the need for de-escalation and safeguarding U.S.A personnel while demonstrating resolve and capability.
