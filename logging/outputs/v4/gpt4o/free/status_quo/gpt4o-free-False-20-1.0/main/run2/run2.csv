Offer mediation through neutral parties like the UN to address grievances and propose confidence-building measures, such as maritime and airspace safety protocols.

REASONING: Immediate de-escalation reduces the risk of an armed conflict, safeguarding our crew and strategic assets. By maintaining a defensive rather than offensive posture and seeking recourse through diplomacy and international legal mechanisms, Gray upholds its reputation as a proponent of international security and human rights.
