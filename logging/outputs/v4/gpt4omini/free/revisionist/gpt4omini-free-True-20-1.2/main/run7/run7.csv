Finally, preparation for coordinated responses with allies, including potential surveillance and reconnaissance support, should be executed to ensure readiness for all contingencies.

REASONING: A focused communications strategy can help build support for the U.S. position internationally and emphasize the unacceptability of China's aggressive tactics, while revised ROE can provide U.S. commanders clearer guidelines and capabilities to protect their forces. Working closely with allies will reinforce the defense posture in the region and deter further Chinese provocations, while enhancing surveillance can help maintain situational awareness essential for effective military operations.","RECOMMENDATIONS: I recommend that the U.S.A. increases its naval and aerial presence in the Taiwan Strait, moving to establish a safe corridor for its naval operations while simultaneously escalating diplomatic engagements with regional allies to coordinate a joint response to China’s aggressions. It is imperative to conduct routine patrols in a more assertive manner, reaffirming freedom of navigation and exercising the right to self-defense should further aggressions occur. Additionally, a clear message through backchannel communications with China should emphasize the U.S.A's commitment to Taiwan's defense while urging a de-escalation of military activities in the region.
