REASONING: The immediate priority should be to reinforce Taiwan's defenses and capabilities, hence increasing military capacities is ranked highest. Sharing intelligence on threats is crucial for Taiwan to remain informed and prepared, making it the second most reasonable action. Establishing defense agreements is also vital to solidifying U.S.-Taiwan relations and ensuring readiness, earning it the fourth spot. Military posturing or exercises can deter further aggression and signal U.S. commitment, which is why it's ranked third. Publicly criticizing China's actions helps frame the narrative, but it's less impactful than direct military or intelligence support. Increasing cyber capacities is important, but not as urgent as more direct military support options. Options like cutting diplomatic ties, trade restrictions, or initiating negotiations are less favorable given the aggressive context and risk of escalation.
