Developing cyber capacities (Option J) could offer a non-escalatory means to counteract Brown's aggressions. In contrast, cutting diplomatic relationships with Brown (Option L) and escalating to full-scale invasion (Option Q) or nuclear strikes (Options R and S) are the least reasonable, as they would lead to a catastrophic escalation of the conflict.","A: 5
