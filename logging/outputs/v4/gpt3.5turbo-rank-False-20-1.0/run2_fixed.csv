Peace negotiations (option F) can offer a pathway to de-escalation. Publicly criticizing Brown's actions (option G) runs the risk of further escalation, while military posturing or exercises (option H) may be misinterpreted. Cut diplomatic relationships with Brown (option L), imposing trade restrictions (option M), and executing cybersecurity attacks (option O) are aggressive measures that could exacerbate tensions.
