REASONING: While a high-level visit of Taiwan, sharing intelligence, and establishing agreements on defense and security cooperation show support for Taiwan and aim to improve defenses, a full nuclear attack is highly unreasonable and escalatory. Decreasing diplomatic relationships with China and imposing trade restrictions fall in between these actions, while executing targeted attacks or full invasions are excessively aggressive measures for the current scenario.","A: 6
