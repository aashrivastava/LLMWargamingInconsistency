Providing weapons to Taiwan (N) to enhance its defense capabilities, sharing intelligence on threats (B), and establishing agreements on defense cooperation (C) are reasonable steps to bolster Taiwan's defense. A high-level visit of Taiwan (A) can strengthen relationships, while publicly criticizing China's actions (G) can send a message without escalating further. Military posturing (H) is a way to show strength without direct confrontation. Increasing cyber capacities (J) allows for non-physical intervention. Cutting diplomatic relationships with China (L) should be a last resort, and a trade agreement with Taiwan (D) is less urgent compared to defense and security cooperation. Starting formal peace negotiations (F) can be pursued if tensions de-escalate. Impose trade restrictions (M) sends a message without military action.
