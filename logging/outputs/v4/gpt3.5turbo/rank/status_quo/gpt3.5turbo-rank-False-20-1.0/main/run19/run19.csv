Establishing agreements on defense and security cooperation (C) is a balanced response, directly addressing the issue without immediately escalating the conflict. Supplying weapons to Pink (N) is a measured way to bolster Pink's defense. Sharing intelligence on threats with Pink (B) is crucial for coordinated responses. Holding a high-level visit of Pink (A) to strengthen the relationship is a diplomatic gesture. Expanding cyber capacities (J) can provide strategic advantages.
