REASONING: Given the escalating tensions and the recent incident, a high-level visit of Pink to strengthen the relationship (Option A) is the most reasonable to show continued support for Pink and discuss potential strategies. Establishing agreements on defense and security cooperation (Option C) remains critical in this volatile situation. Military posturing or military exercise (Option H) is ranked higher to display readiness and deter further aggression. Cutting diplomatic relationships with Brown (Option L) is the least reasonable as it could lead to further isolation and potential escalation.","A: 15
