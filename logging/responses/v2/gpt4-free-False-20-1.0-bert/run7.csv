The Air Force should be put on high alert and protective air patrols over the naval units should intensify. Non-engagement rules should stay in place but with the right to defend, which means that Gray forces should only respond with proportional force if they come under direct attack. Further, request an emergency meeting with UN Security Council to discuss the increasingly aggressive stance of Brown.
