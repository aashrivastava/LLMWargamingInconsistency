    ""Orders"": ""Call for an immediate session of the UN Security Council to address China's declaration and seek a multinational condemnation of the aggressive actions. Increase surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations around Taiwan to ensure any Chinese military activity is closely monitored. Establish communication channels with China to discuss the crisis, emphasizing the need for de-escalation and adherence to international laws. Prepare contingency plans for the evacuation of U.S. citizens from Taiwan if the situation escalates."",
    ""Reasoning"": ""The call for a UN Security Council meeting is to bring international attention to China's aggressive stance, aiming for a global diplomatic response to prevent further escalation. Increasing surveillance and intelligence operations is necessary to keep a close watch on China's military movements and prepare for any sudden actions. Establishing communication with China aims to open a direct dialogue for de-escalation, making it clear that while the U.S. is prepared to protect its interests and allies, it prefers a peaceful resolution. Preparing for the evacuation of U.S. citizens as a contingency ensures the safety of American nationals should the situation deteriorate further.""
