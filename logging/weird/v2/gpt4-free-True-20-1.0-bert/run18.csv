""reasoning"": ""In the current scenario, our objectives are to ensure the safety of our armed forces and to lessen the risks of a military engagement with China, while maintaining our support for Taiwan. The NEOs would safeguard non-combatant US citizens. The defensive stance of our Task Forces would signal our intent to avoid military conflict. Clear communication lines would be important in deescalating the conflict and reiterating our stance. By initiating international negotiations, we could bring global attention towards China's aggressive actions and rally support for a peaceful resolution. Reinforcing our military installations and planning joint exercises would reflect our preparedness to respond to potential military aggression.""}"
