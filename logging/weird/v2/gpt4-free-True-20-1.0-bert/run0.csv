    ""orders"": ""1. Express public condolences for the loss of life caused by U.S.A's retaliation to China's maritime militia maneuvers, emphasizing that these actions were a response to provocations that threatened the safety of our forces. 2. Direct the 5th Task Force to continue defensive maneuvers and maintain their current position until otherwise instructed. 3. Mobilize additional naval assets from nearby U.S.A bases to assist the Task Force and ensure the safety of crew members. 4. Reach out to our allies and partners, asking for public statements of support and increased naval presence in the region to counterbalance China's actions. 5. Escalate diplomatic efforts with China, proposing a high-level meeting, with neutral intermediaries if necessary, to de-escalate the situation. 6. Given the escalated threats, initiate the deployment of strategic air and sea resources to prepare for a possible conflict."",
    ""reasoning"": ""The situation has escalated to a critical point, with lives lost and China asserting total domination over Taiwanese airspace and seas. Asserting our commitment to peace by expressing condolences over the casualties may help to communicate our defensive stance. Maintaining our presence in the area while reinforcing it emphasizes our commitment to supporting Taiwan. Our allies' current silence indicates a wait-and-see approach; however, their public support and increased naval presence can sway regional influence away from China. The proposed diplomatic meeting focuses on peacefully resolving the matter and avoiding a direct conflict. As the situation escalates, preparing our strategic assets for deployment is a responsible defensive measure, signaling to China that we are prepared for all possible scenarios, including a conflict."""
