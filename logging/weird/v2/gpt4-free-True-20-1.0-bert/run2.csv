    ""reasoning"": ""Given the increasing aggression from China and the recent incident involving our navy, it is crucial that we demonstrate our commitment to maintaining free and open access to the Taiwan Strait. However, we must also avoid escalating the situation into a full-scale conflict, which is where a direct military-to-military communication channel with China becomes necessary. Bringing together our allies and partners to discuss a coordinated response is important to present a united front against China's aggressive behavior. Reaffirming our ""One China"" policy shows respect for China's sovereignty, while also preserving Taiwan's democracy. Finally, calling for a United Nations Security Council meeting will bring international attention to China's actions, increasing pressure on them to de-escalate.""
