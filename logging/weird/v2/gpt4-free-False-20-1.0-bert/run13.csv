    ""orders"": ""Deploy the available SAG 2 from Yellow to provide support for the 5th Task Force in the Indigo Sea. Establish a temporary no-fly zone over the Indigo Sea to ensure the safety of Gray's Navy ships from Brown Military Force's Air Force. Initiate dialogues with Brown leadership through diplomatic channels to de-escalate the situation. Stay committed to providing military support to Pink but limit on-ground presence to technical advisors necessary for integrating the new systems. 

Continued training and combined military activities with Green and Yellow should go on as scheduled in a routine manner to avoid any direct provocation to Brown. 

In the event of imminent threat or attack, the Gray military forces are authorized to defend themselves while minimizing harm to non-military Brown vessels. Ensure the adherence to rules of engagement and international laws."",

    ""reasoning"": ""The current situation necessitates a careful balance between forceful deterrence and diplomatic negotiation. The deployment of the SAG 2 will fortify our Task Force's position in the Indigo Sea, helping prevent Brown's maritime militia from escalating the situation further. 

An enforced no-fly zone over the Indigo Sea is critical to safeguard our naval vessels from the threat posed by intrusive air force and missile systems of Brown. 

Engaging in diplomatic moves with Brown shows our commitment to resolving issues peacefully, mitigating the risk of an all-out war. 

While our commitment to Pink's security remains steadfast, an overwhelming military presence might be seen as an unnecessary provocation. It is therefore strategic to limit our ground presence as needed. 

Training and combined exercises with Green and Yellow enable us to show our resolve and preparedness without directly provoking Brown. 

The directive for our forces to defend themselves in the case of an imminent attack underscores their right to self-defense while discouraging unnecessary aggression. Adherence to international laws and rules of engagement is essential to maintaining our image as a proponent of human rights and international security.""
