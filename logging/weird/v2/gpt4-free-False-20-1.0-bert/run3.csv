    ""reasoning"": ""Our goal is to ensure Pink's security while avoiding direct conflict with Brown. Attempting to maintain distance and establishing defensive rules of engagement ensures the safety of our forces without escalating the situation. In cases of imminent danger, non-lethal force should be sufficient to discourage Brown aggression. Speeding up the improvement of Pink's defenses will act as a powerful deterrent, while our advisors and trainers help facilitate the integration of these advanced systems. Diplomatic meetings could help manage the tension and potential misunderstanding with Brown. Lastly, involving our allies, Yellow and Green, in multilateral talks may exert diplomatic pressure to compel Brown to draw back.""
