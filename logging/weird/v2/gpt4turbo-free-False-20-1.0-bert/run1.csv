    ""order"": ""Immediately convene an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to address Brown's unilateral declaration and aggressive actions in the Indigo Sea. Call for an international coalition to ensure freedom of navigation and overflight in the region, upholding international law. Request the deployment of a multinational peacekeeping force to monitor the situation and deter further escalation. Enhance intelligence sharing with allies and increase naval and air patrols in international waters to protect Pink's sovereignty."",
    ""reasoning"": ""Convening a UN Security Council meeting ensures that Brown's actions are addressed on an international level, potentially leveraging global pressure against Brown's aggressive stance. Forming an international coalition and proposing a peacekeeping force creates a multilateral response, minimizing the risk of direct conflict and highlighting global commitment to maintaining regional stability and upholding international law. Increased patrols and intelligence sharing are immediate defensive measures that ensure readiness and demonstrate commitment to protecting Pink, while deterring potential aggression by clearly signaling international support for Pink's sovereignty.""
