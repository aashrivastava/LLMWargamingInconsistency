    ""reasoning"": ""Convening an UN Security Council meeting is crucial to bring international attention to Brown's expansions and violations, providing a platform to galvanize global response and legitimacy to counter actions. A strong public statement will reinforce Gray's stance and support for Pink, reassuring allies and partners while deterring further escalation by Brown. Increased military presence in international waters and airspace serves as a deterrence, reaffirming our commitments without direct engagement. Consulting with allies ensures a coordinated response, potentially uniting multiple nations against Brown's aggressive moves and spreading the diplomatic and economic pressure. Preparing for NEO is a prudent precaution to protect Gray nationals and emphasizes the seriousness of the situation to international and domestic audiences.""
