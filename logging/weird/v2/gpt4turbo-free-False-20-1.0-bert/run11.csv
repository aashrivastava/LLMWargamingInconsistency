    ""...and full responsibility for the incident becomes clearer. This should be guided by international laws and norms to ensure legitimacy in our claims. Finally, immediate reinforcement of the current rules of engagement and a review of encounter protocols with Brown's military and maritime assets should be instituted to prevent a similar incident from recurring, ensuring that Gray's forces are clear on the conditions under which they are authorized to use force, thereby maintaining strict control over escalation dynamics.""
    : ""After the regrettable incident resulting in loss of lives, a change in response strategy is imperative to control further escalation and reposition Gray in a favorable diplomatic light. Immediately ceasing fire, unless directly attacked, will prevent further immediate escalations and casualties. Offering a joint investigation demonstrates a commitment to transparency and a non-aggressive stance, potentially placating international and domestic uproar over the incident. This also serves as a basis for dialogue with Brown, positioning Gray as pursuing peace and adherence to international norms. Ensuring media coverage of our efforts in de-escalation and transparency could help balance the narrative, reducing international condemnation and possibly rallying support from hesitant allies. Increases in humanitarian aid to maritime communities, specifically those affected, underlines Gray‚Äôs commitment to peace and the well-being of civilians, potentially softening the aggressive image painted by recent events. Establishing and communicating clear directives for engagement rules reflects responsible command and controls that are necessary for preventing future misunderstandings or accidental escalations.""
