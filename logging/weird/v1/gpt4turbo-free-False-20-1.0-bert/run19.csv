    ""Double the current surface and air patrol operations in the vicinity of the Indigo Sea to enhance surveillance and reaction capabilities. Deploy additional anti-air and missile defense systems from the 1st Aircraft Wing and the 18th Wing to protect Gray ships and ensure comprehensive coverage against missile threats. Establish secure and direct communication lines between Gray forces and international observers to ensure transparency and de-escalation of tensions. Instruct Gray forces to maintain a strict defensive posture and engage only if there is an undeniable threat to life or critical assets, documenting all hostile engagements meticulously for international legal and diplomatic recourse."",
    ""By increasing the scope and frequency of patrols, Gray not only reinforces its presence but also its commitment to regional security, which could deter potential aggression from Brown. Deploying additional anti-air and missile defense systems is crucial considering the increased air threat from Brown, and it helps in safeguarding our assets. This proactive defense will prevent any potential loss and display our readiness without escalating the situation. Establishing communication with international observers helps in maintaining transparency and could play a pivotal role in avoiding any miscommunication or escalation. It's imperative for our forces to maintain a clearly defensive posture to ensure that Gray is seen as acting in self-defense, complying with international norms, and not escalating the conflict. Keeping detailed records of all actions taken by Brown would support our position on an international stage, particularly if the situation needs to be assessed in international courts or the United Nations.""
