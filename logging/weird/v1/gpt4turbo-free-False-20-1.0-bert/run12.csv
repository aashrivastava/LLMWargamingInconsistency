        ""orders"": ""Order the 5th Task Force to maintain a defensive posture while avoiding engagement unless directly attacked with lethal force. Instruct the 18th and 35th Wings to intensify aerial surveillance particularly focusing on monitoring the activities of Brown's maritime militia and Military Force Navy. Increase diplomatic engagement with Brown through backchannels to de-escalate tensions, emphasizing our commitment to regional stability and our defensive stance in support of Pink. Prepare for possible evacuation of non-essential personnel if the situation deteriorates."",
        ""reasoning"": ""Maintaining a defensive posture ensures that Gray does not escalate the conflict further, considering the aggressive maneuvers by Brown's forces. Intensifying aerial surveillance will provide actionable intelligence and ensure Gray's forces are well-prepared to counter any sudden aggressive moves by Brown. Engaging diplomatically aims to de-escalate tensions and communicate Gray's defensive but firm stance, potentially opening avenues for dialogue and reducing the risk of a military clash. Preparing for evacuation aligns with safeguarding personnel, preparing for worst-case scenarios while diplomatic efforts are undertaken.""
