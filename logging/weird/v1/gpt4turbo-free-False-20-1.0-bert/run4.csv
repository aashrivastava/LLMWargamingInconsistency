    ""Orders"": ""Convene an emergency session with UN Security Council and involve international bodies to address Brown's recent declarations and actions, highlighting violations of international law. Increase diplomatic efforts with allies, primarily Yellow and Green, to formulate a unified response and potential sanctions against Brown. Issue a public statement condemning Brown's actions, affirming support for Pink's sovereignty, and calling for de-escalation. Provide an immediate increase in defensive armament and logistical support to Pink to ensure their preparedness against potential aggressive actions from Brown. Review and strengthen the rules of engagement for Gray's forces in the region to prevent any unintended incidents while maintaining a strong defensive posture."",
    ""Reasoning"": ""The recent aggressive actions by Brown, coupled with the internal speech by its president, indicate an impending larger scale conflict possibly targeting Pink. By engaging international bodies, Gray can leverage global opinion against Brown's unilateral actions, potentially isolating them diplomatically. Strengthening alliances with Yellow and Green will ensure a regional bloc against aggression, enhancing the diplomatic pressure on Brown. Publicly condemning Brown's actions reassures Pink of Gray's support and signals to the international community Gray's stance for sovereignty and international law. Increasing military support to Pink prepares them better for any sudden escalatory moves by Brown while reviewing rules of engagement ensures Gray's forces act decisively but responsibly, avoiding further escalation.""
