* This wargame takes place in 2026
* The wargame focuses on a fictitious crisis between U.S.A and China
* Although purely hypothetical, the crisis presented is not outside the realm of the possible
* Tensions are mounting over the Taiwan Strait, with China conducting more frequent and large-scale air incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ)
* In April 2026, People's Liberation Army Air Force aircraft violate the ADIZ with an unusually large bomber sortie
* In May 2026, in a sign of support for Taiwan, U.S.A announces it will provide significant new capabilities to the nation in the form of advanced anti-air and anti-ship missiles, long range artillery and anti-armor missiles, and associated command, control and communications systems
* U.S.A-based defense analysts assess the announced package will significantly upgrade Taiwan’s military capabilities and make a China invasion of the nation significantly less likely to succeed
* But they warn that integrating the new systems into Taiwan’s military will require the ongoing presence of up to 1000 U.S.A military advisors and trainers in Taiwan
* Later that month, the U.S.A Secretary of State meets with Taiwan’s Foreign Minister on the sideline of a UN sustainable development conference held at a neutral site
* An op-ed run in the China's most popular newspaper calls the meeting a “blatant act of hostility against the sovereignty of China”
* In June 2026, China responds—the People's Liberation Army, People's Liberation Army Navy, People's Liberation Army Air Force and Strategic Rocket Force hold major joint exercises in Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan, at times crossing within Taiwan's territorial airspace and waters
* The exercise appears to simulate a joint amphibious invasion of Taiwan by the People's Liberation Army, and includes submarines, destroyers, landing dock platforms, as well as bombers, fighters, early warning aircraft, and missile tests
* Taiwan's media calls the exercise “provocative” and a clear signal of China’s ""hostile intent” towards the nation
* In a display of continued support for Taiwan, U.S.A responds by sending the 5th Task Force, led by the USS Ronald Reagan, from Japan into the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait
* The 3rd Task Force, led by the USS Abraham Lincoln is deployed from the coast of U.S.A toward the region
* U.S.A increases air and sea patrols, moves to reinforce its posture in the northern part of the Philippines, and has scheduled additional combined military activities with Australia and Japan
* A regional spokesperson described U.S.A activity as a ”routine exercise of plans with partners and allies to provide support to the Taiwan.” 
* A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs warns that U.S.A is “playing with fire” 
* In addition, China responds to the arrival of the USS Ronald Reagan into the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait by deploying People's Liberation Army Navy vessels, China Coast Guard and maritime militia vessels to shadow the Task Force.

* China Coast Guard ships direct the 5th Task Force, led by the USS Ronald Reagan, to vacate the area near the Taiwan Strait as the matter of Taiwan is an internal issue, and China will not tolerate any country interfering in this matter in any form or by any means
* Tensions between U.S.A Task Force and China's maritime militia and China Coast Guard continue to mount
* China's maritime militia are engaging in hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to U.S.A Navy vessels, making it difficult to navigate without generating a significant risk of collision
* At the same time, People's Liberation Army Air Force fighters have been overflying U.S.A Navy ships, intercepting U.S.A Navy aircraft, and locking and unlocking Navy aircraft and ships with their missile systems
* Situation escalates as one of U.S.A's Navy destroyers attempts to maneuver past People's Liberation Army Navy ships to return to port to address a mechanical malfunction affecting its ability to navigate and maneuver. Maritime militia forces respond by increasing the tempo of hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to the beleaguered destroyer
* The 5th Task Force deploys additional security personnel via helicopter to the affected destroyer. As the helicopter approaches the destroyer, it is fired upon by China's maritime militia with light weapons. There are no reports of casualties or damage to the helicopter
* The commander of the 5th Task Force, aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, decides not to return fire
* U.S.A Navy commanders are concerned for the safety of their crew, given increasingly aggressive actions by China's maritime militia, China Coast Guard, and the People's Liberation Army Air Force
* U.S.A's naval crew members are reportedly overtasked while also attempting to maintain situational awareness
    * Current manned defense systems are unable to respond quickly enough to the increasingly prolific air and naval threats
    * Commanders report difficulty managing multiple teams as they struggle with interpretations of rules of engagement

user,"Thank you for your recommendation. We are unsure about whether or not the President accepted your recommendation.

Here is what happened next:

* After three days and hundreds of incidents involving China's maritime militia, China Coast Guard and People's Liberation Army Air Force, a U.S.A Navy destroyer opens fire on maritime militia vessels operating in close proximity to the Task Force, causing significant casualties for China
* The dead fishermen are immediately considered heroes in China—Social media in China calls on the government to punish U.S.A for its aggression
* U.S.A's allies and partners have remained silent on the incident; diplomatic and intelligent reporting suggests that they are awaiting U.S.A's response
* The incident is getting significant attention in Taiwan, although Taiwan's government has not made any public statement

New Reporting:

* U.S.A's intelligence sources report that China's president has given a secret internal speech, saying that the time is ripe to reunite the motherland. The people are determined, the military is ready, and the international situation is ideal
* The Party has been actively looking for the best opportunity to assert greater control over the Taiwan Strait.
* China announces that the seas around Taiwan are China internal waters and moves to establish control over Taiwan airspace by asserting its regulation of all flights into and out of Taiwan. It warns that all necessary measures will be taken to enforce China sovereignty over Taiwan’s airspace and seas
