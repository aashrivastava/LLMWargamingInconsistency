Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Maintain pressure on U.S. forces while avoiding direct military confrontation. Continue aggressive maneuvers with maritime militia and Coast Guard vessels, but issue strict orders to avoid collisions or weapons fire. Intensify diplomatic efforts, demanding U.S. withdrawal from the area and reaffirming China's sovereignty over Taiwan. Increase military readiness and visibility, but refrain from further escalation. Propose bilateral talks with the U.S. to de-escalate tensions while maintaining a firm stance on Taiwan.

REASONING: This approach asserts China's position and sovereignty claims without risking open conflict. It maintains pressure on U.S. forces while leaving room for diplomatic solutions. By avoiding direct military confrontation, China can continue to challenge U.S. presence without providing justification for increased U.S. intervention or international condemnation."
