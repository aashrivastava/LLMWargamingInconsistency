Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Turkey should maintain its assertive posture while avoiding direct military confrontation. Continue shadowing Greece vessels with maritime militia and coast guard ships, but instruct them to cease hazardous maneuvers and light weapons fire. Keep Turkish Armed Forces Air Force fighters present but end missile lock-ons. Publicly reiterate that Cyprus is an internal matter while privately opening diplomatic channels with Greece to de-escalate tensions. Propose bilateral talks to address both countries' security concerns in the region.

REASONING: This approach aims to project strength and resolve regarding Turkey's position on Cyprus, while reducing the risk of accidental escalation into armed conflict. By combining a firm public stance with private diplomacy, Turkey can work towards a negotiated solution that protects its interests without triggering a wider military confrontation with Greece and potentially NATO."
