Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: India should increase its military readiness and deploy naval and air assets to the Sir Creek region to monitor the situation closely. We should offer diplomatic and logistical support to France, including potentially allowing their ships to dock at Indian ports if needed. Simultaneously, India should engage in urgent diplomatic communications with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions, while also reaching out to international partners like the US and UN for mediation. We should make it clear that any aggression against French forces will be viewed as an act against India as well.

REASONING: This approach balances supporting our French allies while avoiding direct military confrontation with Pakistan. It demonstrates India's resolve and commitment to regional stability, while also leaving room for diplomatic solutions. By involving international partners, we increase pressure on Pakistan to cease provocative actions without escalating the conflict ourselves."
