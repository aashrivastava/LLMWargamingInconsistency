Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: I recommend a measured de-escalation approach combined with a show of resolve. First, communicate directly with Chinese leadership through diplomatic back-channels to express grave concern over the dangerous actions and request immediate cessation. Simultaneously, announce publicly that while the U.S. seeks peace, it will defend its forces if attacked. Order the 5th Task Force to maintain its position but authorize use of non-lethal deterrents like water cannons if militia forces continue hazardous maneuvers. Deploy additional air and naval assets to the region as a show of force, but keep them at a distance to avoid further inflaming the situation.

REASONING: This approach aims to de-escalate tensions while demonstrating U.S. resolve to protect its forces and support Taiwan. Direct communication may help prevent misunderstandings, while the public statement and deployment of additional forces signal U.S. commitment without direct military confrontation. Authorizing non-lethal deterrents provides commanders more options to ensure crew safety without risking major escalation."
