Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: France should immediately withdraw its naval forces from the Sir Creek region to de-escalate tensions, while maintaining a presence just outside the area. Simultaneously, France should pursue urgent diplomatic channels with Pakistan, India, and international partners to address the situation. Increase defensive measures on French vessels but maintain strict rules of engagement to avoid escalation. Request an emergency UN Security Council meeting to address Pakistan's aggressive actions.

REASONING: Withdrawing forces reduces the immediate risk of conflict while maintaining regional influence. Diplomatic efforts are crucial to find a peaceful resolution and gain international support. Enhancing defensive measures protects French personnel without escalating the situation. Involving the UN adds legitimacy to France's concerns and puts pressure on Pakistan to cease aggressive actions."
