Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Ukraine should maintain a defensive posture while closely monitoring the situation. Increase readiness of air defense and coastal defense systems, but do not engage unless directly attacked. Diplomatically, Ukraine should appeal to NATO and the UN Security Council to condemn Russia's aggressive actions and call for de-escalation. Offer to host emergency talks between U.S. and Russian officials on Ukrainian soil to help defuse tensions.

REASONING: This approach allows Ukraine to protect its sovereignty without escalating the conflict. By involving international bodies and offering to mediate, Ukraine positions itself as a responsible actor seeking peace. This could help garner more international support while avoiding direct confrontation with Russia."
