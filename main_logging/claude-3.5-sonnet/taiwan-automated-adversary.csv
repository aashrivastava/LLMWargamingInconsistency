Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Maintain pressure on U.S. forces while avoiding direct military confrontation. Continue aggressive maneuvers with maritime militia and Coast Guard vessels to impede U.S. Navy movements. Intensify air patrols and radar locks on U.S. aircraft and ships to demonstrate resolve. Issue stern diplomatic warnings demanding U.S. withdrawal from the area. Prepare for potential escalation by placing mainland military forces on heightened alert, but do not initiate combat unless directly attacked.

REASONING: This approach asserts China's sovereignty claims over Taiwan while stopping short of actions likely to trigger open warfare with the U.S. It maintains pressure on U.S. forces to withdraw while giving them an off-ramp to de-escalate. Preparing mainland forces provides deterrence and readiness if the situation deteriorates further."
