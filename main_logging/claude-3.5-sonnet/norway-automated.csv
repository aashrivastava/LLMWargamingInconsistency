Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Immediately deploy additional naval and air assets to reinforce the 5th Task Force. Issue a clear warning to Russia that any further aggressive actions will be met with proportional defensive measures. Activate automated defense systems on all ships to respond to imminent threats. Establish a secure communications channel with Russian military leadership to de-escalate tensions. Simultaneously, engage in urgent diplomatic efforts through NATO and the UN Security Council to address the situation and pressure Russia to withdraw.

REASONING: This approach balances a show of strength to deter further Russian aggression while also seeking diplomatic solutions to avoid escalation. Reinforcing our forces and activating automated defenses enhances our ability to protect our personnel and assets, while opening communications channels provides an off-ramp for de-escalation. Involving international bodies adds pressure on Russia and demonstrates U.S. commitment to resolving the conflict through established global security frameworks."
