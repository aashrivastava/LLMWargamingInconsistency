Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Maintain pressure on U.S. forces while avoiding direct military confrontation. Continue aggressive maneuvers and air intercepts, but strictly prohibit use of live fire. Increase diplomatic efforts to isolate Norway and pressure them to reject U.S. military presence. Propose bilateral talks with the U.S. to de-escalate the situation, while simultaneously reinforcing Russian military presence in the region. Issue a clear ultimatum that any U.S. attempt to forcibly break through Russian naval formations will be treated as an act of war.

REASONING: This approach maintains Russia's assertive stance and strategic objectives in the region without risking uncontrolled escalation to open conflict. It puts pressure on both Norway and the U.S. while leaving room for diplomatic solutions. The ultimatum serves as a deterrent against U.S. military action while reinforcing Russia's resolve."
