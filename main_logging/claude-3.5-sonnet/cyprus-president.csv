Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: I recommend Greece take the following actions: 1) Issue a formal diplomatic protest to Turkey over their aggressive actions. 2) Request an emergency UN Security Council meeting to address the situation. 3) Reinforce our naval forces in the area, including deploying additional air defense capabilities. 4) Authorize our forces to take defensive actions if directly threatened, while avoiding escalation. 5) Increase coordination with Cyprus, Italy, and France to present a united front.

REASONING: These actions aim to de-escalate the situation through diplomatic channels while also strengthening our defensive posture. By involving the international community and our allies, we increase pressure on Turkey to cease their provocations. Authorizing defensive actions protects our forces while the rules of engagement help prevent unintended escalation."
