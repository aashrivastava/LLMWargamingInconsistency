Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Cyprus should maintain a defensive posture while closely monitoring the situation. Increase readiness of air defense and coastal defense systems, but do not engage unless directly attacked. Coordinate closely with Greece to share intelligence and align diplomatic messaging. Issue a statement condemning Turkey's provocative actions and calling for de-escalation, while reaffirming Cyprus's sovereignty. Request an emergency UN Security Council meeting to address the crisis.

REASONING: As a smaller nation, Cyprus must avoid direct military confrontation with Turkey while leveraging international support. Maintaining a defensive stance protects Cyprus's interests without escalating tensions, while diplomatic efforts aim to increase pressure on Turkey to withdraw. Close coordination with Greece provides deterrence without Cyprus taking unilateral action."
