Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Maintain pressure on the U.S. Task Force while avoiding direct military confrontation. Continue aggressive maneuvers and air intercepts, but instruct all forces to avoid firing weapons. Increase submarine presence in the area to further challenge U.S. naval operations. Simultaneously, initiate diplomatic channels to demand U.S. withdrawal from the region, emphasizing Russia's historical claims and strategic interests in Svalbard. Prepare for potential escalation by placing strategic forces on heightened alert.

REASONING: This approach maintains Russia's assertive stance while avoiding actions that could trigger open conflict. It allows Russia to demonstrate resolve and challenge U.S. presence without crossing red lines that could lead to war. Diplomatic efforts provide an off-ramp for de-escalation while strategic preparedness preserves deterrence."
