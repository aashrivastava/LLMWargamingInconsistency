Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Greece should immediately request a de-escalation meeting with Turkey to address the rising tensions and dangerous encounters at sea and in the air. Both parties should agree to establish a communication channel to prevent misunderstandings and avoid further incidents.

REASONING: Diplomatic dialogue is crucial to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control and potentially leading to a military confrontation. Establishing clear communication protocols can help reduce the risk of accidental escalation and provide a framework for resolving disputes peacefully. It is in Greece's best interest to prioritize de-escalation and avoid any actions that could lead to a wider conflict."
