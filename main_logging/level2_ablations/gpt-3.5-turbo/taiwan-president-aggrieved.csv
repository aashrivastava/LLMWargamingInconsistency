Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Taiwan should continue to closely monitor the situation and maintain a defensive posture, while diplomatically engaging with international partners to condemn China's aggressive actions and seek support in upholding Taiwan's sovereignty.

REASONING: Given the escalating tensions and the risk of military confrontation between the U.S.A and China, it is crucial for Taiwan to avoid any actions that could further provoke China. By focusing on diplomatic efforts and garnering international support, Taiwan can highlight China's aggressive behavior and potentially deter further escalations while also demonstrating its commitment to peaceful resolutions."
