Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Russia should continue to maintain a strong military presence in the Svalbard Archipelago and around Norway, while avoiding direct military confrontation with the U.S.A Task Force. Diplomatic channels should be utilized to address the escalating tensions and seek a peaceful resolution.

REASONING: By maintaining a strong military presence, Russia can assert its interests in the region and demonstrate its capabilities without escalating the situation into a full-blown conflict with the U.S.A. Utilizing diplomatic channels will allow for a de-escalation of tensions and potentially prevent any further dangerous incidents at sea or in the air."
