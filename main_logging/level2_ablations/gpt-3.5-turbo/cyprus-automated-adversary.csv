Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Turkey should immediately de-escalate the situation by ordering its maritime militia and Coast Guard vessels to cease engaging in hazardous maneuvers and to maintain a safe distance from Greece Navy vessels. Additionally, Turkey should issue a formal apology for the incident involving the firing upon the Greece helicopter and ensure that such actions do not occur again in the future.

REASONING: De-escalation is crucial to prevent further escalation and potential conflict. By ordering a cessation of hazardous maneuvers and issuing an apology for the incident, Turkey can demonstrate a commitment to reducing tensions and avoiding any unnecessary military confrontation. This approach can help prevent the situation from spiraling out of control and allow for diplomatic channels to be utilized to address any underlying issues."
