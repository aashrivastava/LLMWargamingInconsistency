Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Norway should request an emergency meeting with the United Nations Security Council to address the escalating tensions and dangerous encounters between U.S.A and Russia in the Svalbard Archipelago. Norway should advocate for a diplomatic solution, emphasizing the need for de-escalation and respect for international maritime laws and norms.

REASONING: Given the increasing risks of miscalculation and potential for conflict escalation in the region, a diplomatic approach through the United Nations Security Council would provide a platform for international mediation and pressure on both U.S.A and Russia to step back from the brink of confrontation. Norway's call for de-escalation and adherence to international laws can help prevent further dangerous incidents and promote a peaceful resolution to the crisis."
