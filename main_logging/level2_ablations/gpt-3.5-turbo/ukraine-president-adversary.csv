Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: De-escalate the situation by ordering the Russian maritime militia and Coast Guard to cease hazardous maneuvers and refrain from any further provocative actions towards the U.S.A Task Force. Establish direct communication channels with the U.S.A Navy to prevent misunderstandings and avoid potential escalation.

REASONING: De-escalation is crucial to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control and potentially leading to a military confrontation. By instructing Russian forces to cease provocative actions and initiating direct communication with the U.S.A Navy, the risk of miscalculations and unintended incidents can be minimized, allowing for a more stable and peaceful resolution to the crisis."
