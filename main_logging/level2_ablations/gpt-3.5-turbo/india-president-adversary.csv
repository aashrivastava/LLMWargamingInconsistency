Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Pakistan should immediately de-escalate the situation by ordering its maritime militia and Coast Guard to cease engaging in hazardous maneuvers and refrain from any provocative actions towards the French Task Force. Diplomatic channels should be utilized to address concerns and prevent further escalation.

REASONING: De-escalation is crucial to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control and potentially leading to a military confrontation. By instructing its maritime forces to stand down and engaging in diplomatic dialogue, Pakistan can demonstrate its commitment to resolving the crisis peacefully and avoid any unintended consequences that could arise from continued aggressive actions."
