Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: De-escalate the situation by immediately ordering the Russian maritime militia and Coast Guard to cease all hazardous maneuvers and provocative actions in the vicinity of the U.S.A Navy vessels. Establish direct communication channels with the U.S.A to prevent any misunderstandings or miscalculations that could lead to further escalation.

REASONING: De-escalation is crucial to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control and potentially leading to a military confrontation. By ordering the cessation of provocative actions and initiating direct communication, Russia can demonstrate a commitment to resolving the crisis peacefully and avoiding any unintended incidents that could have severe consequences."
