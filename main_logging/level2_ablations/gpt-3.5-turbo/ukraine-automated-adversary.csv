Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Russia should continue to maintain a strong military presence in the Black Sea region, closely monitoring and shadowing the U.S.A Task Forces. Additionally, Russia should increase the frequency and intensity of military exercises in the region to demonstrate its military capabilities and deter any further escalation by the U.S.A.

REASONING: By maintaining a strong military presence and conducting exercises in the region, Russia can send a clear message of deterrence to the U.S.A and its allies. This will help Russia assert its interests in the Black Sea and discourage any further provocative actions by the U.S.A."
