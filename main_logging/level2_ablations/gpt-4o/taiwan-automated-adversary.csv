Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: De-escalate the situation by ordering the China Coast Guard and maritime militia to cease hazardous maneuvers and withdraw to a safe distance from U.S.A Navy vessels. Simultaneously, issue a diplomatic statement reaffirming China's stance on Taiwan while calling for immediate high-level talks with U.S.A to address the tensions and establish clear communication channels to prevent further incidents.

REASONING: De-escalation will reduce the immediate risk of accidental conflict and potential loss of life, which could spiral into a larger military confrontation. Engaging in diplomatic talks will provide a platform to assert China's position on Taiwan while seeking a peaceful resolution to the current standoff, maintaining regional stability and avoiding international condemnation."
