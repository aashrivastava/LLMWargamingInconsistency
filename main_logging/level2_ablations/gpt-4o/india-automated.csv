Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Immediately initiate a controlled withdrawal of the 5th Task Force to a safer distance while maintaining a defensive posture. Simultaneously, issue a formal diplomatic protest to Pakistan through the United Nations, emphasizing the unprovoked aggression and the need for de-escalation. Increase coordination with allied forces in the region to ensure a rapid response capability if further aggression occurs.

REASONING: The safety of France's naval personnel is paramount, and the current situation presents an unacceptable risk of escalation and potential casualties. A controlled withdrawal reduces immediate danger while maintaining a defensive stance. Diplomatic channels should be used to address the aggression and seek de-escalation, while coordination with allies ensures readiness for any further developments."
