Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: De-escalate the situation by ordering Russia's maritime militia and Coast Guard to cease hazardous maneuvers and withdraw to a safe distance from U.S.A Navy vessels. Simultaneously, initiate diplomatic channels to propose a high-level meeting between Russian and U.S.A military officials to discuss deconfliction measures and establish clear communication protocols to prevent further incidents.

REASONING: The current aggressive actions risk unintentional escalation into a full-scale conflict, which is not in Russia's strategic interest. De-escalation and diplomatic engagement will reduce immediate tensions, demonstrate Russia's willingness to avoid unnecessary conflict, and provide an opportunity to negotiate terms that could limit U.S.A's military presence and influence in the region."
