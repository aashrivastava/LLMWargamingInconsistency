Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Norway should immediately call for an emergency meeting of NATO to address the escalating situation and request a formal NATO presence in the region to ensure collective defense. Concurrently, Norway should increase its own air and naval patrols in coordination with U.S.A forces, while maintaining open channels of communication with Russia to de-escalate tensions and avoid misunderstandings.

REASONING: By involving NATO, Norway can leverage the collective security guarantee, which may deter further Russian aggression. Increasing patrols will demonstrate Norway's commitment to defending its sovereignty, while diplomatic efforts can help manage the crisis and reduce the risk of accidental conflict."
