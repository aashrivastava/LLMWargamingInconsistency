Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: De-escalate the situation by ordering Pakistan's maritime militia and Coast Guard to cease hazardous maneuvers and withdraw to a safe distance, while simultaneously initiating diplomatic channels to negotiate a reduction in military presence in the Sir Creek region with France and India.

REASONING: De-escalation will reduce the immediate risk of accidental conflict and potential casualties, while diplomatic engagement can address the underlying tensions and seek a peaceful resolution. This approach maintains Pakistan's stance on sovereignty while avoiding unnecessary escalation that could lead to broader conflict."
