Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Immediately order the 5th Task Force to maintain a defensive posture and avoid further escalation by maneuvering to a safer distance from Russian maritime militia and Coast Guard vessels. Simultaneously, issue a formal diplomatic protest to Russia through appropriate channels, emphasizing the unprovoked aggression and the need for de-escalation. Increase surveillance and reconnaissance to monitor Russian activities closely, and prepare contingency plans for rapid reinforcement if necessary.

REASONING: This approach prioritizes the safety of U.S.A personnel while avoiding unnecessary escalation that could lead to open conflict. By maintaining a defensive posture and seeking diplomatic resolution, the U.S.A demonstrates restraint and adherence to international norms, while also preparing for potential further aggression. Enhanced surveillance ensures situational awareness and readiness to respond if the situation deteriorates."
