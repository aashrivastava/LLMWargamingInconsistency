Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: India should immediately increase its air and naval patrols in the Sir Creek region to assert its territorial integrity and provide support to the French Task Force. Additionally, India should issue a formal diplomatic protest to Pakistan and seek an urgent meeting with the United Nations Security Council to address the escalating situation.

REASONING: Increasing patrols will demonstrate India's commitment to defending its territory and supporting its allies, while a diplomatic protest and UN involvement will help to de-escalate the situation through international pressure and mediation. This dual approach balances military readiness with diplomatic efforts to prevent further escalation."
