Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Ukraine should immediately increase its air and naval patrols within its territorial waters and airspace, focusing on monitoring and documenting all Russian military activities. Additionally, Ukraine should request an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to address the escalating situation and seek international diplomatic support.

REASONING: By increasing patrols, Ukraine can better safeguard its sovereignty and gather evidence of Russian provocations. An emergency UN Security Council meeting will help to internationalize the issue, potentially leading to diplomatic pressure on Russia to de-escalate, while also demonstrating Ukraine's commitment to resolving the crisis through international law and cooperation."
