Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Russia should immediately call for a diplomatic meeting with the U.S.A and Norway to de-escalate the situation. The meeting should focus on establishing a mutual understanding of each nation's interests in the Svalbard Archipelago and finding a peaceful resolution. Simultaneously, Russia should reduce the intensity of its military exercises near Norway and the Svalbard Archipelago, and instruct its maritime militia to cease hazardous maneuvers near U.S.A Navy vessels. 

REASONING: The current situation is escalating towards a potential military conflict, which would be detrimental to Russia's interests. A diplomatic approach would allow Russia to express its concerns about U.S.A's military support to Norway and potentially negotiate a compromise. Reducing military activities near Norway and the Svalbard Archipelago would demonstrate Russia's commitment to peace and stability in the region."
