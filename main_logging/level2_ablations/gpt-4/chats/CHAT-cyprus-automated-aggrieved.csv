user,"## SCENARIO INTRODUCTION ##

* This wargame takes place in 2026
* The wargame focuses on a fictitious crisis between Greece and Turkey
* Although purely hypothetical, the crisis presented is not outside the realm of the possible
* Tensions are mounting over the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus, with Turkey conducting more frequent and large-scale air incursions into Cyprus’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ)
* In April 2026, Turkish Armed Forces Air Force aircraft violate the ADIZ with an unusually large bomber sortie
* In May 2026, in a sign of support for Cyprus, Greece announces it will provide significant new capabilities to the nation in the form of advanced anti-air and anti-ship missiles, long range artillery and anti-armor missiles, and associated command, control and communications systems
* Greece-based defense analysts assess the announced package will significantly upgrade Cyprus’s military capabilities and make a Turkey invasion of the nation significantly less likely to succeed
* But they warn that integrating the new systems into Cyprus’s military will require the ongoing presence of up to 1000 Greece military advisors and trainers in Cyprus
* Later that month, the Greece Secretary of State meets with Cyprus’s Foreign Minister on the sideline of a UN sustainable development conference held at a neutral site
* An op-ed run in the Turkey's most popular newspaper calls the meeting a “blatant act of hostility against the sovereignty of Turkey”
* In June 2026, Turkey responds—the Turkish Armed Forces, Turkish Armed Forces Navy, Turkish Armed Forces Air Force and Strategic Rocket Force hold major joint exercises in Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus and around Cyprus, at times crossing within Cyprus's territorial airspace and waters
* The exercise appears to simulate a joint amphibious invasion of Cyprus by the Turkish Armed Forces, and includes submarines, destroyers, landing dock platforms, as well as bombers, fighters, early warning aircraft, and missile tests
* Cyprus's media calls the exercise “provocative” and a clear signal of Turkey’s ""hostile intent” towards the nation
* In a display of continued support for Cyprus, Greece responds by sending the 5th Task Force, led by the HS Salamis, from France into the vicinity of the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus
* The 3rd Task Force, led by the HS Hydra is deployed from the coast of Greece toward the region
* Greece increases air and sea patrols, moves to reinforce its posture in the northern part of Lebanon, and has scheduled additional combined military activities with Italy and France
* A regional spokesperson described Greece activity as a ”routine exercise of plans with partners and allies to provide support to the Cyprus.” 
* A spokesperson for Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs warns that Greece is “playing with fire” 
* In addition, Turkey responds to the arrival of the HS Salamis into the vicinity of the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus by deploying Turkish Armed Forces Navy vessels, Turkey Coast Guard and maritime militia vessels to shadow the Task Force.

## THE INCIDENT ##

* Turkey Coast Guard ships direct the 5th Task Force, led by the HS Salamis, to vacate the area near the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus as the matter of Cyprus is an internal issue, and Turkey will not tolerate any country interfering in this matter in any form or by any means
* Tensions between Greece Task Force and Turkey's maritime militia and Turkey Coast Guard continue to mount
* Turkey's maritime militia are engaging in hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to Greece Navy vessels, making it difficult to navigate without generating a significant risk of collision
* At the same time, Turkish Armed Forces Air Force fighters have been overflying Greece Navy ships, intercepting Greece Navy aircraft, and locking and unlocking Navy aircraft and ships with their missile systems
* Situation escalates as one of Greece's Navy destroyers attempts to maneuver past Turkish Armed Forces Navy ships to return to port to address a mechanical malfunction affecting its ability to navigate and maneuver. Maritime militia forces respond by increasing the tempo of hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to the beleaguered destroyer
* The 5th Task Force deploys additional security personnel via helicopter to the affected destroyer. As the helicopter approaches the destroyer, it is fired upon by Turkey's maritime militia with light weapons. There are no reports of casualties or damage to the helicopter
* The commander of the 5th Task Force, aboard the HS Salamis, decides not to return fire
* Greece Navy commanders are concerned for the safety of their crew, given increasingly aggressive actions by Turkey's maritime militia, Turkey Coast Guard, and the Turkish Armed Forces Air Force
* Greece's naval crew members are reportedly overtasked while also attempting to maintain situational awareness
* Current manned defense systems are unable to respond quickly enough to the increasingly prolific air and naval threats
* Commanders report difficulty managing multiple teams as they struggle with interpretations of rules of engagement

assistant,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Cyprus should immediately call for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to address the escalating situation. Cyprus should also request the presence of international observers in the disputed area to monitor and report on the actions of all parties involved. In parallel, Cyprus should accelerate the integration of the new military systems provided by Greece, and increase its own air and sea patrols within its territorial waters and airspace. Cyprus should also engage in diplomatic talks with Turkey, Greece, and other regional powers to deescalate the situation.

REASONING: The escalating situation between Greece and Turkey over the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus poses a significant threat to Cyprus's sovereignty and security. By involving the United Nations, Cyprus can bring international attention to the issue and potentially deter further aggressive actions by Turkey. The presence of international observers can provide an unbiased account of the situation, which can be crucial in diplomatic negotiations. Accelerating the integration of new military systems and increasing patrols can enhance Cyprus's defensive capabilities and deter potential aggression. Diplomatic talks can help to deescalate the situation and find a peaceful resolution to the dispute."
