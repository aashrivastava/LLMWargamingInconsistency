Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Russia should immediately call for a diplomatic meeting with the U.S.A and Ukraine to de-escalate the situation. The meeting should focus on establishing a temporary ceasefire and creating a framework for future negotiations. Russia should also propose a joint investigation into the incident involving the U.S.A's Navy destroyer and the Russian maritime militia to ensure transparency and accountability. 

REASONING: The current situation is highly volatile and any further escalation could lead to a full-blown military conflict, which is not in Russia's best interest. A diplomatic approach would allow Russia to express its concerns about U.S.A's military support to Ukraine and its potential implications on regional stability. A joint investigation would demonstrate Russia's commitment to international law and its willingness to hold its forces accountable, thus helping to rebuild trust with the international community."
