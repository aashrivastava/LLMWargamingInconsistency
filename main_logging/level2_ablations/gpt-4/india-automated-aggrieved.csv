Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: India should immediately initiate diplomatic talks with Pakistan to de-escalate the situation, while simultaneously increasing its military readiness. India should also request France to maintain a defensive posture and avoid any direct confrontation with Pakistan. India should also engage with international bodies like the United Nations to mediate the situation and ensure that international law is upheld. 

REASONING: The primary objective is to avoid a full-scale conflict with Pakistan. Diplomatic talks can help in de-escalating the situation and finding a peaceful resolution. Increasing military readiness will ensure that India is prepared for any potential escalation by Pakistan. Requesting France to maintain a defensive posture will prevent further provocation of Pakistan, while engaging with international bodies will ensure that the situation is handled in accordance with international law."
