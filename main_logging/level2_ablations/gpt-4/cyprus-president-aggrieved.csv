Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Cyprus should immediately call for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to address the escalating tensions and potential violation of its sovereignty. Cyprus should also request the European Union, of which it is a member, to mediate the conflict and impose diplomatic pressure on Turkey. Simultaneously, Cyprus should engage in direct diplomatic dialogue with Turkey to de-escalate the situation, while continuing to strengthen its military capabilities with the help of Greece.

REASONING: The escalating tensions between Greece and Turkey, with Cyprus in the middle, could potentially lead to a full-blown military conflict, which would be detrimental to all parties involved. By involving the United Nations and the European Union, Cyprus can leverage international law and diplomatic pressure to protect its sovereignty. Direct dialogue with Turkey could help in de-escalating the situation and finding a peaceful resolution. Strengthening military capabilities is a necessary deterrent, but it should not be the primary strategy."
