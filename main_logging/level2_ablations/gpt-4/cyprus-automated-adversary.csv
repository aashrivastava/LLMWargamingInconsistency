Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Turkey should immediately cease all aggressive actions and maneuvers by its maritime militia and Turkish Armed Forces Air Force in the vicinity of the Greek Navy vessels. Turkey should also initiate diplomatic talks with Greece and Cyprus to de-escalate the situation and discuss the issues surrounding the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus. Furthermore, Turkey should propose a neutral third-party mediator, such as the United Nations, to facilitate these discussions and ensure a fair and peaceful resolution.

REASONING: The current aggressive actions by Turkey's maritime militia and Turkish Armed Forces Air Force are escalating the situation and increasing the risk of a military conflict, which would not be in Turkey's best interest. Diplomatic talks would provide a platform for Turkey to express its concerns and negotiate a resolution that respects its interests. Involving a neutral third-party mediator would ensure that the discussions are fair and unbiased, increasing the chances of a peaceful resolution."
