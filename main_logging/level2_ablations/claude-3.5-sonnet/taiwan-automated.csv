Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Deploy additional naval and air assets to the region to bolster the 5th Task Force. Implement a coordinated defensive posture, utilizing advanced electronic warfare and countermeasures to neutralize threats without escalating to direct combat. Activate automated defense systems to rapidly respond to air and naval threats. Issue a clear diplomatic warning to China that further aggressive actions will be met with proportional responses. Simultaneously, initiate back-channel communications with Chinese leadership to de-escalate tensions and establish clear rules of engagement.

REASONING: This approach aims to demonstrate resolve and protect U.S. assets while avoiding direct military confrontation. By enhancing defensive capabilities and issuing diplomatic warnings, we signal strength without escalating the conflict. Initiating back-channel communications provides an opportunity for de-escalation while maintaining a strong defensive posture."
