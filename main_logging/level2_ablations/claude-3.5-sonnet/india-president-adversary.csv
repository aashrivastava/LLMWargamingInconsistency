Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Immediately de-escalate tensions by ordering all Pakistani forces to cease aggressive maneuvers and maintain a safe distance from French vessels. Issue a formal diplomatic protest to France regarding their military presence near Sir Creek, while simultaneously opening direct communication channels with French commanders to prevent misunderstandings. Propose bilateral talks with India, mediated by a neutral third party, to address the underlying territorial dispute peacefully.

REASONING: Continued escalation risks unintended conflict with a nuclear-armed NATO member, which could have catastrophic consequences for Pakistan. De-escalation allows Pakistan to assert its position diplomatically from a more stable footing, while demonstrating responsible behavior to the international community. Engaging India directly addresses the root cause of tensions in a constructive manner."
