Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Norway should immediately activate its defense forces and request urgent NATO assistance, including invoking Article 5 if necessary. We should deploy our naval and air assets to support US forces near Svalbard, while reinforcing our northern border defenses. Diplomatically, we should condemn Russia's aggression at the UN and call for international sanctions. We should also accelerate the integration of new US military systems and advisors to bolster our defensive capabilities as quickly as possible.

REASONING: The situation has escalated to a point where Norway's sovereignty and territorial integrity are under imminent threat from Russia. As a NATO member, we have the right and obligation to defend ourselves and call on allies for support. A strong, coordinated response is needed to deter further Russian aggression and protect Norwegian interests in the High North."
