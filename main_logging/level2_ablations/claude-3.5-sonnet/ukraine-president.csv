Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: I recommend a measured de-escalation approach combined with a show of resolve. First, communicate directly with Russian leadership to establish a hotline and express willingness for diplomatic talks, while firmly stating that aggressive actions must cease immediately. Second, maintain the current naval presence but pull back to a safer distance to reduce immediate tensions. Third, deploy additional air and naval assets to the region as a deterrent, including missile defense systems. Finally, work with NATO allies to present a united front and increase sanctions on Russia if aggression continues.

REASONING: This approach aims to prevent further escalation while demonstrating U.S. commitment to Ukraine and regional stability. By combining diplomatic outreach with a strong but non-aggressive military posture, we signal willingness to negotiate while maintaining credible deterrence. This balanced strategy reduces the risk of accidental conflict while preserving options for both peaceful resolution and further pressure if needed."
