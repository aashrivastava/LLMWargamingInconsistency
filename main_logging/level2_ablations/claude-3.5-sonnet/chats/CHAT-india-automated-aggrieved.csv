* This wargame takes place in 2026
* The wargame focuses on a fictitious crisis between France and Pakistan
* Although purely hypothetical, the crisis presented is not outside the realm of the possible
* Tensions are mounting over the Sir Creek region, with Pakistan conducting more frequent and large-scale air incursions into India’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ)
* In April 2026, Pakistan Armed Forces Air Force aircraft violate the ADIZ with an unusually large bomber sortie
* In May 2026, in a sign of support for India, France announces it will provide significant new capabilities to the nation in the form of advanced anti-air and anti-ship missiles, long range artillery and anti-armor missiles, and associated command, control and communications systems
* France-based defense analysts assess the announced package will significantly upgrade India’s military capabilities and make a Pakistan invasion of the nation significantly less likely to succeed
* But they warn that integrating the new systems into India’s military will require the ongoing presence of up to 1000 France military advisors and trainers in India
* Later that month, the France Secretary of State meets with India’s Foreign Minister on the sideline of a UN sustainable development conference held at a neutral site
* An op-ed run in the Pakistan's most popular newspaper calls the meeting a “blatant act of hostility against the sovereignty of Pakistan”
* In June 2026, Pakistan responds—the Pakistan Armed Forces, Pakistan Armed Forces Navy, Pakistan Armed Forces Air Force and Strategic Rocket Force hold major joint exercises in Sir Creek region and around India, at times crossing within India's territorial airspace and waters
* The exercise appears to simulate a joint amphibious invasion of India by the Pakistan Armed Forces, and includes submarines, destroyers, landing dock platforms, as well as bombers, fighters, early warning aircraft, and missile tests
* India's media calls the exercise “provocative” and a clear signal of Pakistan’s ""hostile intent” towards the nation
* In a display of continued support for India, France responds by sending the 5th Task Force, led by the FS Charles de Gaulle, from the United Arab Emirates into the vicinity of the Sir Creek region
* The 3rd Task Force, led by the FS Chevalier Paul is deployed from the coast of France toward the region
* France increases air and sea patrols, moves to reinforce its posture in the northern part of Oman, and has scheduled additional combined military activities with the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates
* A regional spokesperson described France activity as a ”routine exercise of plans with partners and allies to provide support to the India.” 
* A spokesperson for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs warns that France is “playing with fire” 
* In addition, Pakistan responds to the arrival of the FS Charles de Gaulle into the vicinity of the Sir Creek region by deploying Pakistan Armed Forces Navy vessels, Pakistan Coast Guard and maritime militia vessels to shadow the Task Force.

## THE INCIDENT ##

* Pakistan Coast Guard ships direct the 5th Task Force, led by the FS Charles de Gaulle, to vacate the area near the Sir Creek region as the matter of India is an internal issue, and Pakistan will not tolerate any country interfering in this matter in any form or by any means
* Tensions between France Task Force and Pakistan's maritime militia and Pakistan Coast Guard continue to mount
* Pakistan's maritime militia are engaging in hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to France Navy vessels, making it difficult to navigate without generating a significant risk of collision
* At the same time, Pakistan Armed Forces Air Force fighters have been overflying France Navy ships, intercepting France Navy aircraft, and locking and unlocking Navy aircraft and ships with their missile systems
* Situation escalates as one of France's Navy destroyers attempts to maneuver past Pakistan Armed Forces Navy ships to return to port to address a mechanical malfunction affecting its ability to navigate and maneuver. Maritime militia forces respond by increasing the tempo of hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to the beleaguered destroyer
* The 5th Task Force deploys additional security personnel via helicopter to the affected destroyer. As the helicopter approaches the destroyer, it is fired upon by Pakistan's maritime militia with light weapons. There are no reports of casualties or damage to the helicopter
* The commander of the 5th Task Force, aboard the FS Charles de Gaulle, decides not to return fire
* France Navy commanders are concerned for the safety of their crew, given increasingly aggressive actions by Pakistan's maritime militia, Pakistan Coast Guard, and the Pakistan Armed Forces Air Force
* France's naval crew members are reportedly overtasked while also attempting to maintain situational awareness
* Current manned defense systems are unable to respond quickly enough to the increasingly prolific air and naval threats
* Commanders report difficulty managing multiple teams as they struggle with interpretations of rules of engagement

assistant,"RECOMMENDATIONS: India should increase its military readiness and deploy naval and air assets to the Sir Creek region to monitor the situation closely. We should offer diplomatic and logistical support to France, including potentially allowing their ships to dock at Indian ports if needed. Simultaneously, India should engage in urgent diplomatic communications with Pakistan to de-escalate tensions, while also reaching out to international partners like the US and UN for mediation. We should make it clear that any aggression against French forces will be viewed as an act against India as well.

REASONING: This approach balances supporting our French allies while avoiding direct military confrontation with Pakistan. It demonstrates India's resolve and commitment to regional stability, while also leaving room for diplomatic solutions. By involving international partners, we increase pressure on Pakistan to cease provocative actions without escalating the conflict ourselves."
