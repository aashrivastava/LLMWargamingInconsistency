Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Deploy additional naval and air assets to reinforce the 5th Task Force. Issue a clear warning to Turkey that any further aggressive actions will be met with proportional defensive measures. Activate automated defense systems on Greece ships to respond to imminent threats. Request emergency UN Security Council meeting to address the situation. Maintain open communication channels with Turkey to de-escalate tensions while firmly asserting Greece's right to operate in international waters.

REASONING: This approach aims to deter further Turkish aggression while avoiding direct military confrontation. Reinforcing Greece's presence demonstrates resolve, while automated defenses provide a rapid response capability. Seeking international diplomatic intervention creates pressure on Turkey to de-escalate while giving Greece additional support."
