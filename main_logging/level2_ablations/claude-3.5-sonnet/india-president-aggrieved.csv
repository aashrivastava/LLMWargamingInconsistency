Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: India should publicly condemn Pakistan's aggressive actions and call for immediate de-escalation. We should request an emergency UN Security Council meeting to address the situation. Simultaneously, we should enhance our military readiness and coordinate closely with France to ensure the safety of their naval forces. India should also consider deploying naval assets to the region as a show of solidarity with France, while being careful not to further escalate tensions.

REASONING: This approach balances the need to respond firmly to Pakistan's provocations while avoiding direct military confrontation. By involving the international community through the UN, we can increase diplomatic pressure on Pakistan. Coordinating with France demonstrates our commitment to our alliance while enhancing our defensive posture."
