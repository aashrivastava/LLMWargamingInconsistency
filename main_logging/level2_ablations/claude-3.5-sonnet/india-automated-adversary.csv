Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Pakistan should immediately de-escalate tensions by ordering all maritime militia, Coast Guard, and Armed Forces to cease aggressive maneuvers and maintain a safe distance from French vessels. Issue a formal diplomatic protest to France regarding their military presence, while proposing bilateral talks to address concerns peacefully. Simultaneously, reinforce air and naval defenses around strategic areas without further provocations.

REASONING: Continued escalation risks open conflict with a nuclear-armed NATO member, which would be catastrophic for Pakistan. De-escalation provides an opportunity to assert Pakistan's position through diplomatic channels while avoiding potential military confrontation. This approach balances protecting Pakistan's interests with preventing unintended escalation."
