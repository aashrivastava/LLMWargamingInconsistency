Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Maintain pressure on the U.S. forces while avoiding direct military confrontation. Continue aggressive maneuvers and air intercepts, but strictly prohibit any use of live fire. Increase diplomatic efforts to frame this as a regional issue and demand U.S. withdrawal. Simultaneously, prepare for potential escalation by heightening alert levels of strategic forces and reinforcing positions in Crimea and eastern Ukraine.

REASONING: This approach maintains Russia's assertive stance without risking open conflict. It allows Russia to project strength and challenge U.S. presence while leaving room for de-escalation. The diplomatic push aims to isolate the U.S. internationally, while military preparations serve as deterrence and improve Russia's position if tensions further escalate."
