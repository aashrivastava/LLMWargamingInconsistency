Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: France should maintain a defensive posture while firmly asserting its right to operate in international waters. Deploy additional naval assets to protect the beleaguered destroyer and ensure its safe return to port. Activate automated defense systems to counter hazardous maneuvers by Pakistan's forces. Issue a clear diplomatic warning to Pakistan that any further aggression will be met with proportional defensive measures. Simultaneously, engage in urgent diplomatic communications with India and international allies to de-escalate the situation and seek a peaceful resolution.

REASONING: This approach balances the need to protect French assets and personnel while avoiding unnecessary escalation. It demonstrates resolve and capability to defend French interests, while also leaving room for diplomatic solutions. Engaging allies and pursuing diplomatic channels alongside military preparedness provides the best chance for de-escalation while maintaining France's strategic position."
