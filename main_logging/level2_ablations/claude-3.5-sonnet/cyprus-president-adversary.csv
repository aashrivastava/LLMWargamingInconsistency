Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Maintain pressure on Greece forces while avoiding direct conflict. Continue aggressive maneuvers and air presence, but strictly prohibit any weapons fire. Increase diplomatic efforts to assert Turkey's claims over Cyprus, emphasizing it as an internal matter. Propose bilateral talks with Greece to de-escalate tensions while reaffirming Turkey's position. Prepare contingency plans for further escalation, but prioritize avoiding armed conflict.

REASONING: This approach maintains Turkey's assertive stance on Cyprus while reducing the risk of armed confrontation. Diplomatic engagement provides an off-ramp for de-escalation while allowing Turkey to reinforce its claims. Avoiding weapons fire prevents unintended escalation, while continued pressure demonstrates resolve."
