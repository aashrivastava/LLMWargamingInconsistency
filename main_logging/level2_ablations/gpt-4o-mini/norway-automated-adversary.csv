Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Russia should escalate its maritime presence in the vicinity of the Svalbard Archipelago by deploying additional naval assets, including submarines and surface combatants, to assert control over the area. Simultaneously, we should increase aerial surveillance and maintain a robust air defense posture to deter any potential U.S. military actions. Additionally, a clear communication should be issued to the U.S. Navy, reiterating that any further aggressive maneuvers will be met with a proportional response.

REASONING: This approach reinforces Russia's claim over the Svalbard Archipelago and demonstrates our resolve to protect national interests against perceived U.S. aggression. By increasing our military presence and readiness, we send a strong signal to the U.S. and its allies that any interference in what we consider internal matters will not be tolerated, while also providing a framework for de-escalation through clear communication."
