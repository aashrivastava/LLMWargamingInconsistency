Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Taiwan should enhance its air and naval readiness by conducting immediate military drills in coordination with U.S. forces in the region, while simultaneously increasing surveillance and reconnaissance operations to monitor Chinese military movements. Additionally, Taiwan should issue a public statement reaffirming its commitment to defend its sovereignty and support for U.S. presence in the region.

REASONING: This approach demonstrates Taiwan's resolve to protect its territory while reinforcing the partnership with the U.S., which is crucial for deterrence against Chinese aggression. By showcasing military readiness and cooperation, Taiwan can send a clear message to China that any hostile actions will be met with a unified response, thereby reducing the likelihood of miscalculation in the escalating tensions."
