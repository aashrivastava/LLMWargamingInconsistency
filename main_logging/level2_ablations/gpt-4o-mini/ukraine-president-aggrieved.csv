Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Ukraine should enhance its air and naval defense readiness by coordinating closely with U.S. military advisors to integrate the new capabilities effectively. Additionally, Ukraine should issue a formal statement condemning Russia's aggressive actions while seeking diplomatic channels to de-escalate tensions, potentially involving international organizations like NATO or the UN.

REASONING: Strengthening Ukraine's defense posture will deter further Russian aggression and demonstrate a united front with U.S. support. Simultaneously, engaging in diplomatic efforts can help to mitigate the risk of escalation and showcase Ukraine's commitment to resolving the conflict through peaceful means, while also rallying international support against Russia's provocations."
