Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Cyprus should enhance its air and naval defense readiness by coordinating closely with Greece to establish a unified command structure for joint operations. Additionally, Cyprus should issue a formal statement condemning Turkey's aggressive maneuvers and reaffirming its commitment to sovereignty, while simultaneously seeking diplomatic channels to de-escalate tensions.

REASONING: Strengthening military readiness in collaboration with Greece will deter further Turkish aggression and ensure the safety of both nations' forces. A clear diplomatic stance will signal to Turkey that Cyprus is resolute in defending its sovereignty, while also opening avenues for dialogue to prevent escalation into conflict."
