Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Russia should escalate its maritime presence in the Black Sea by deploying additional naval assets to assert control over the area and conduct live-fire exercises in close proximity to the U.S. Task Force. Simultaneously, Russia should increase aerial patrols and maintain a heightened state of readiness for its air and naval forces, while issuing clear warnings to the U.S. Navy regarding the consequences of further provocations.

REASONING: This approach demonstrates Russia's resolve to protect its interests in the Black Sea and signals to the U.S. that any further interference will be met with a robust military response. By showcasing military strength and readiness, Russia aims to deter U.S. actions while reinforcing its narrative of defending national sovereignty against foreign aggression."
