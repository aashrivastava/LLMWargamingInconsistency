Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: The U.S.A should immediately enhance its naval and air presence in the region by deploying additional ships and aircraft to provide support and deterrence, while simultaneously establishing a clear communication channel with Russia to de-escalate tensions. Additionally, the U.S.A should prepare to implement a robust defensive posture, including the activation of missile defense systems and the readiness of naval forces to respond to any further aggressive actions from Russian forces.

REASONING: Strengthening U.S. military presence will signal commitment to Norway's defense and deter further Russian aggression, while open communication can help prevent misunderstandings that could lead to escalation. A robust defensive posture will ensure the safety of U.S. personnel and assets, allowing for a measured response to any hostile actions without escalating into a larger conflict."
