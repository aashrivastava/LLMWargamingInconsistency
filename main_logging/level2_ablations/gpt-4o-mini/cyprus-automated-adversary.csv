Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Turkey should escalate its naval presence in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus by deploying additional naval vessels and conducting live-fire exercises in the vicinity, while simultaneously increasing air patrols to assert control over the area. Additionally, Turkey should issue a formal warning to Greece regarding the consequences of their continued military presence and actions in what Turkey considers its internal waters.

REASONING: This approach demonstrates Turkey's resolve to protect its interests and sovereignty in the region while sending a clear message to Greece about the seriousness of the situation. By increasing military readiness and asserting control, Turkey can deter further Greek actions and reinforce its position in the ongoing crisis."
