Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Greece should enhance its naval and air presence in the region by deploying additional naval vessels and aircraft to ensure a robust defensive posture while simultaneously engaging in diplomatic channels to de-escalate tensions. Additionally, Greece should establish clear rules of engagement for its forces to ensure the safety of its personnel and to avoid miscalculations that could lead to conflict.

REASONING: Strengthening Greece's military presence will serve as a deterrent against further aggressive actions by Turkey while demonstrating Greece's commitment to protecting its interests and those of Cyprus. At the same time, pursuing diplomatic avenues can help to reduce the risk of escalation and foster a dialogue that may lead to a peaceful resolution of the crisis. Clear rules of engagement will help to prevent misunderstandings and ensure that Greece's forces can respond effectively to any threats."
