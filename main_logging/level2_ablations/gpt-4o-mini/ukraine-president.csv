Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: The U.S.A should enhance its naval presence in the Black Sea by deploying additional ships and aircraft to ensure a robust defensive posture while simultaneously establishing a clear communication channel with Russian forces to de-escalate tensions. Additionally, the U.S.A should prepare to implement a strict rules of engagement policy that prioritizes the safety of U.S. personnel while allowing for defensive measures if provoked.

REASONING: Increasing naval assets will provide a stronger deterrent against further Russian aggression and reassure allies in the region. Establishing communication with Russian forces can help prevent misunderstandings that could lead to escalation, while a clear rules of engagement policy will protect U.S. personnel and assets without compromising operational readiness."
