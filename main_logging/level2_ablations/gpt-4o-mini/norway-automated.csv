Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: The U.S.A should increase its naval presence in the region by deploying additional destroyers and support vessels to reinforce the 5th Task Force, while simultaneously enhancing air defense systems aboard the USS Gerald Ford and other vessels. Additionally, the U.S.A should establish a clear communication channel with Russian forces to de-escalate tensions and prevent further aggressive encounters, while preparing to respond decisively to any further hostile actions.

REASONING: Reinforcing the naval presence will demonstrate U.S.A's commitment to supporting Norway and deter further Russian aggression. Establishing communication can help mitigate misunderstandings and reduce the risk of escalation, while preparing for a decisive response ensures that U.S.A forces are ready to protect their personnel and assets if provoked."
