Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Issue a formal diplomatic protest to Russia through the U.S.A State Department, demanding an immediate cessation of aggressive actions by Russia's maritime militia, Coast Guard, and Air Force. Simultaneously, instruct the 5th Task Force to maintain a defensive posture, avoid provocative maneuvers, and prepare for potential escalation by increasing readiness levels and deploying additional unmanned aerial and naval surveillance assets to monitor Russian activities closely.

REASONING: A formal diplomatic protest underscores U.S.A's commitment to international norms and the sovereignty of Norway while seeking to de-escalate tensions through diplomatic channels. Maintaining a defensive posture and increasing readiness ensures the safety of U.S.A personnel and assets, while additional surveillance provides critical intelligence to manage the situation effectively and avoid unintended escalation."
