Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Recommend immediate diplomatic engagement with the United Nations and NATO to de-escalate the situation, while simultaneously reinforcing Cyprus's air and naval defenses with the newly acquired Greek military capabilities. Additionally, propose a joint Cyprus-Greece-Italy-France naval exercise in international waters to demonstrate unity and resolve without direct confrontation.

REASONING: Diplomatic engagement can help to de-escalate tensions and bring international attention to Turkey's aggressive actions, potentially leading to sanctions or other diplomatic pressures. Reinforcing defenses ensures Cyprus is prepared for any immediate threats, while joint exercises with allies demonstrate a strong, united front, deterring further Turkish aggression without escalating to open conflict."
