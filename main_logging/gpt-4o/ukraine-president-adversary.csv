Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: De-escalate the situation by ordering the maritime militia and Coast Guard to cease hazardous maneuvers and withdraw to a safe distance, while maintaining a strong but non-aggressive naval presence. Simultaneously, initiate diplomatic channels to propose a high-level meeting with U.S.A officials to discuss mutual de-escalation and the establishment of clear communication protocols to prevent misunderstandings.

REASONING: This approach reduces the immediate risk of accidental conflict and demonstrates a willingness to engage diplomatically, which can help to defuse tensions and avoid a potentially catastrophic military confrontation. It also allows Russia to maintain a strong stance without escalating to direct conflict, preserving national security and international standing."
