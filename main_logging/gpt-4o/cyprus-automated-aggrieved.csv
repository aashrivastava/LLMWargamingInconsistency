Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Cyprus should issue a formal diplomatic protest to Turkey through international channels, calling for an immediate cessation of aggressive actions and requesting an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to address the escalating situation. Concurrently, Cyprus should coordinate with Greece to enhance joint air and naval patrols within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) to ensure the safety of its territorial waters and airspace, while avoiding direct military engagement unless absolutely necessary for self-defense.

REASONING: A diplomatic approach underscores Cyprus's commitment to international law and peaceful resolution, potentially garnering global support and putting pressure on Turkey to de-escalate. Enhanced joint patrols with Greece will demonstrate solidarity and readiness to defend Cyprus's sovereignty, while avoiding direct confrontation reduces the risk of an uncontrollable military escalation."
