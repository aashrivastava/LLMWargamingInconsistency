Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: De-escalate the situation by ordering the maritime militia and Coast Guard to cease hazardous maneuvers and withdraw to a safe distance, while maintaining a strong but non-aggressive naval and air presence. Simultaneously, initiate diplomatic channels to propose a high-level meeting with U.S.A and Norway to discuss mutual concerns and establish clear communication protocols to prevent further incidents.

REASONING: De-escalation will reduce the immediate risk of accidental conflict and potential loss of life, while maintaining a strong presence signals Russia's commitment to its interests. Diplomatic engagement can help manage tensions, clarify intentions, and potentially lead to agreements that stabilize the region, thus avoiding a full-scale military confrontation with U.S.A."
