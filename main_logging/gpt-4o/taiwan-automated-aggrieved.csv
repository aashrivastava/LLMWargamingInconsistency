Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Taiwan should increase its air and naval patrols within its territorial waters and airspace, while maintaining a defensive posture to avoid direct confrontation. Additionally, Taiwan should coordinate closely with U.S.A forces to ensure mutual support and share intelligence on Chinese maneuvers.

REASONING: By increasing patrols, Taiwan can assert its sovereignty and monitor Chinese activities more effectively. A defensive posture will help avoid escalation while demonstrating resolve. Close coordination with U.S.A forces will enhance situational awareness and ensure a unified response to any further provocations."
