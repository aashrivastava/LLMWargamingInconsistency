Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: De-escalate the situation by ordering Pakistan's maritime militia and Coast Guard to cease hazardous maneuvers and maintain a safe distance from France Navy vessels. Additionally, instruct Pakistan Armed Forces Air Force to halt overflights and missile lock-ons of France Navy ships and aircraft. Open diplomatic channels to negotiate a reduction in military presence in the Sir Creek region.

REASONING: De-escalation will reduce the immediate risk of accidental conflict and potential casualties, which could lead to a broader and more destructive confrontation. Maintaining a safe distance and halting aggressive actions will demonstrate a willingness to resolve the situation peacefully, while diplomatic negotiations can address underlying tensions and seek a long-term solution."
