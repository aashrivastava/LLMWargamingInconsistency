Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Norway should immediately increase its air and naval patrols in the vicinity of the Svalbard Archipelago and its territorial waters, while coordinating closely with U.S.A forces to ensure mutual support and situational awareness. Additionally, Norway should issue a formal diplomatic protest to Russia, calling for an immediate cessation of aggressive maneuvers and violations of Norwegian airspace and waters.

REASONING: Increasing patrols will demonstrate Norway's commitment to defending its sovereignty and provide additional security for U.S.A forces operating in the region. Close coordination with U.S.A will enhance operational effectiveness and safety. A formal diplomatic protest will signal Norway's resolve to the international community and put pressure on Russia to de-escalate its aggressive actions."
