Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: De-escalate the situation by ordering the People's Liberation Army Navy, China Coast Guard, and maritime militia to cease hazardous maneuvers and aggressive actions, and initiate diplomatic channels to negotiate a reduction in military presence in the Taiwan Strait with U.S.A.

REASONING: De-escalation will reduce the risk of accidental conflict and potential loss of life, while diplomatic negotiations can provide a platform to address China's concerns about sovereignty and U.S.A's military support for Taiwan. This approach maintains China's strategic objectives without provoking a direct military confrontation."
