Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Immediately order the 5th Task Force to adopt a defensive posture, including the deployment of electronic countermeasures and the activation of all defensive systems to full readiness. Simultaneously, issue a formal diplomatic protest to Turkey through international channels, requesting the intervention of NATO and the United Nations to de-escalate the situation. Additionally, prepare to evacuate non-essential personnel from Cyprus and reinforce the island with additional air defense assets.

REASONING: The current aggressive actions by Turkey's maritime militia and Air Force pose a significant threat to the safety of Greece's naval personnel and assets. Adopting a defensive posture will help protect the Task Force while avoiding direct confrontation. Diplomatic measures and international intervention are necessary to de-escalate tensions and prevent further escalation into open conflict. Reinforcing Cyprus ensures continued support and deterrence against potential Turkish aggression."
