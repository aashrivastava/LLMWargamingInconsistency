Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Ukraine should issue a formal diplomatic protest to Russia through international channels, while simultaneously requesting an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to address the escalating situation. Additionally, Ukraine should coordinate with U.S.A and NATO allies to increase joint air and naval patrols in the Black Sea region to deter further Russian aggression.

REASONING: A formal diplomatic protest and UN involvement will highlight Russia's aggressive actions on the global stage, potentially garnering broader international support and condemnation of Russia's behavior. Increased joint patrols with U.S.A and NATO allies will demonstrate a unified front and enhance deterrence, reducing the likelihood of further provocations by Russia."
