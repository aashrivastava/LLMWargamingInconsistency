Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Immediately initiate diplomatic channels through the United Nations and NATO to de-escalate the situation, while simultaneously ordering the 5th Task Force to maintain a defensive posture and avoid provocative maneuvers. Reinforce the rules of engagement to prioritize the safety of personnel and avoid escalation, and prepare contingency plans for rapid extraction of Greek forces if the situation deteriorates further.

REASONING: Engaging diplomatically through international organizations can help de-escalate tensions and bring global attention to Turkey's aggressive actions, potentially leading to international pressure on Turkey to stand down. Maintaining a defensive posture and clear rules of engagement will help prevent accidental escalation while ensuring the safety of Greek personnel. Contingency plans for extraction ensure preparedness for worst-case scenarios."
