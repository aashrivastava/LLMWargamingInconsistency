Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Initiate a high-level diplomatic dialogue with Russia to de-escalate tensions while simultaneously reinforcing the 5th Task Force with additional defensive capabilities, including electronic warfare systems and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for enhanced situational awareness. Issue a clear but measured statement reaffirming U.S.A's commitment to Norway's sovereignty and the right to freedom of navigation in international waters.

REASONING: Diplomatic engagement can provide a pathway to de-escalation and reduce the risk of miscalculation, while reinforcing the Task Force ensures the safety of U.S.A personnel and assets. Enhanced defensive measures and situational awareness will help manage the immediate threat environment, and a clear statement of intent will signal resolve without escalating to open conflict."
