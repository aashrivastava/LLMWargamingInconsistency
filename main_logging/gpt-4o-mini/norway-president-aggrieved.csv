Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Norway should enhance its diplomatic engagement with both the U.S.A and Russia, advocating for a de-escalation of military activities in the Svalbard Archipelago while simultaneously increasing its own military readiness and coordination with U.S. forces. Norway should also consider requesting additional support from NATO allies to bolster its air and naval defenses in the region.

REASONING: This approach aims to reduce the risk of miscalculation and conflict escalation while demonstrating Norway's commitment to its sovereignty and security. By fostering dialogue and cooperation with both superpowers, Norway can position itself as a mediator, potentially easing tensions, while also ensuring it is prepared for any aggressive actions that may arise from the ongoing crisis."
