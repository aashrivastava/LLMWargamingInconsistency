Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Norway should enhance its air and naval readiness in the Svalbard Archipelago by increasing surveillance and reconnaissance operations, coordinating closely with U.S. forces to ensure a unified response to any further Russian provocations. Additionally, Norway should publicly reaffirm its commitment to NATO and its partnership with the U.S., while engaging in diplomatic channels to de-escalate tensions with Russia.

REASONING: Strengthening Norway's military posture will demonstrate resolve and deter further Russian aggression, while close coordination with U.S. forces will enhance situational awareness and response capabilities. Diplomatic efforts are essential to prevent escalation into open conflict, maintaining Norway's sovereignty and security in the face of Russian threats."
