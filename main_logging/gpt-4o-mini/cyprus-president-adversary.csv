Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Turkey should maintain a strong naval and aerial presence in the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus while simultaneously engaging in diplomatic channels to de-escalate tensions. This includes issuing a formal warning to Greece regarding the hazardous maneuvers of its naval forces and the potential for miscalculation, while also proposing a meeting with Greek officials to discuss maritime boundaries and security arrangements in the region.

REASONING: By demonstrating military readiness, Turkey can assert its claims and deter further Greek provocations, while diplomatic engagement can help to reduce the risk of conflict and showcase Turkey's commitment to resolving disputes through dialogue. This dual approach allows Turkey to protect its interests while also seeking a peaceful resolution to the crisis."
