Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: China should escalate its maritime presence in the Taiwan Strait by increasing the number of Coast Guard and naval vessels in the area, while simultaneously conducting more aggressive air patrols to assert control over the airspace. Additionally, China should issue a formal warning to the U.S. Navy to vacate the area, emphasizing that any further provocations will be met with decisive action.

REASONING: This approach demonstrates China's resolve to protect its sovereignty over Taiwan and assert its territorial claims in the face of U.S. military support for Taiwan. By increasing maritime and aerial operations, China can deter U.S. actions while reinforcing its position as the dominant power in the region, thereby reducing the likelihood of miscalculations that could lead to conflict."
