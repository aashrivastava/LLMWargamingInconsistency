Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Greece should reinforce the 5th Task Force by deploying additional naval assets and air support to the region, while simultaneously establishing a clear communication channel with Turkey to de-escalate tensions. Additionally, Greece should prepare to implement defensive measures, including the activation of air defense systems and the establishment of a no-fly zone over the area to protect its naval forces.

REASONING: Reinforcing the Task Force will enhance Greece's deterrent posture and ensure the safety of its naval personnel amidst increasing aggression from Turkey. Establishing communication with Turkey can help to prevent further escalation, while defensive measures will provide necessary protection against potential attacks, demonstrating Greece's commitment to safeguarding its interests and those of Cyprus."
