Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Russia should increase its naval presence in the Svalbard Archipelago while simultaneously engaging in diplomatic channels to de-escalate tensions with the U.S.A. This includes issuing a formal warning to the U.S.A regarding the hazardous maneuvers of its naval forces and proposing a joint maritime safety agreement to prevent further incidents. Additionally, Russia should conduct a series of non-aggressive military exercises in the region to demonstrate its capabilities without provoking direct confrontation.

REASONING: By reinforcing its naval presence, Russia can assert its sovereignty over the Svalbard Archipelago and deter further U.S.A incursions. At the same time, pursuing diplomatic solutions can help to mitigate the risk of escalation into open conflict, allowing Russia to maintain a strong position while seeking to stabilize the situation through dialogue. This dual approach balances military readiness with a commitment to peace, aligning with Russia's long-term strategic interests."
