Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Ukraine should enhance its air and naval surveillance capabilities in the Black Sea region, coordinate closely with U.S. forces to ensure a unified response to Russian provocations, and prepare for potential defensive operations if the situation escalates further. Additionally, Ukraine should issue a strong diplomatic statement condemning Russia's aggressive actions and reaffirming its commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity.

REASONING: Strengthening surveillance will provide better situational awareness and allow for timely responses to any hostile actions. Coordinating with U.S. forces will demonstrate a united front against Russian aggression, while a diplomatic statement will reinforce Ukraine's position on the international stage and seek to garner further support from allies."
