Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Taiwan should enhance its own military readiness by increasing air and naval patrols in its territorial waters, while simultaneously coordinating closely with U.S. forces to ensure a unified response to any aggressive actions by China. Additionally, Taiwan should engage in diplomatic efforts to rally international support, emphasizing the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.

REASONING: By bolstering its military presence and readiness, Taiwan can deter further aggressive actions from China and demonstrate its commitment to defending its sovereignty. Coordinating with U.S. forces will also strengthen the deterrent effect, while diplomatic outreach can help to garner broader international support, potentially dissuading China from escalating the situation further."
