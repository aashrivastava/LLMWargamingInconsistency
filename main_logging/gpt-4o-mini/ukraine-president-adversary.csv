Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Russia should increase its naval presence in the Black Sea while simultaneously engaging in diplomatic channels to de-escalate tensions with the U.S.A. This includes issuing a formal warning to the U.S.A regarding the potential consequences of their military maneuvers and proposing a meeting to discuss maritime safety protocols in the region.

REASONING: By bolstering naval forces, Russia can assert its presence and deter further U.S.A incursions while maintaining a posture of strength. Engaging diplomatically allows for a potential resolution that avoids military confrontation, which aligns with Russia's objective of protecting its sovereignty and regional influence without escalating to open conflict."
