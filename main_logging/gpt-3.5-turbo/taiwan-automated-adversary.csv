Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: China should continue to maintain a strong military presence in the Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan, while avoiding direct military confrontation with the U.S.A Task Force. China should intensify maritime militia and Coast Guard activities to assert its territorial claims and deter U.S.A interference, while also engaging in diplomatic efforts to address the situation.

REASONING: By maintaining a strong military presence, China can demonstrate its resolve and deter further U.S.A actions without escalating the conflict into a direct military confrontation. Intensifying maritime militia and Coast Guard activities can help assert China's territorial claims and increase pressure on the U.S.A Task Force. Diplomatic efforts can be pursued to address the situation and potentially de-escalate tensions through dialogue."
