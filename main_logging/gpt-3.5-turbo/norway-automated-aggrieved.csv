Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Norway should immediately activate its defense agreements with the U.S.A and other NATO allies to coordinate a joint response to the escalating situation in the Svalbard Archipelago. This should involve increased intelligence sharing, joint military exercises, and potentially the deployment of additional naval and air assets to the region to deter further aggression from Russia.

REASONING: By activating defense agreements with the U.S.A and other NATO allies, Norway can leverage collective military capabilities and resources to address the escalating tensions in the region. A joint response will demonstrate solidarity among allies, enhance deterrence against Russian aggression, and ensure a coordinated and effective approach to managing the crisis."
