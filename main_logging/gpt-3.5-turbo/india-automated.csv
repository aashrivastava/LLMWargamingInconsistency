Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: France should issue a formal diplomatic protest to Pakistan regarding the aggressive actions of its maritime militia and armed forces, emphasizing the need for de-escalation and respect for international maritime laws and norms. Additionally, France should request the intervention of a neutral third party mediator to help defuse the situation and prevent further escalation.

REASONING: Diplomatic channels should be utilized first to address the escalating tensions and avoid any unnecessary military confrontation. Involving a neutral third party mediator can help facilitate communication between France and Pakistan, potentially leading to a peaceful resolution of the conflict. This approach aligns with France's diplomatic objectives and can help prevent the situation from spiraling out of control."
