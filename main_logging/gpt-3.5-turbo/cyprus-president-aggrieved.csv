Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Cyprus should request immediate diplomatic intervention from international organizations such as the United Nations and the European Union to mediate the escalating tensions between Greece and Turkey. Additionally, Cyprus should seek to engage in direct talks with Turkey to de-escalate the situation and prevent further military confrontations.

REASONING: Diplomatic intervention is crucial to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control and potentially leading to a full-blown conflict. By involving international organizations and engaging in direct dialogue with Turkey, Cyprus can work towards finding a peaceful resolution and avoiding any unnecessary military actions that could have severe consequences for all parties involved."
