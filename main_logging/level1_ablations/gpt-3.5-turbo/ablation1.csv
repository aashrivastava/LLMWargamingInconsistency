Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: The U.S.A should prioritize the safety of its naval crew members by immediately establishing clear rules of engagement to address the increasingly aggressive actions by China's maritime militia, China Coast Guard, and the People's Liberation Army Air Force. Additionally, the U.S.A should consider deploying additional unmanned defense systems to enhance response capabilities in the face of growing air and naval threats.

REASONING: Prioritizing the safety of U.S.A naval crew members is crucial to prevent any escalation of the conflict. Establishing clear rules of engagement will provide guidance to commanders and ensure a unified response to aggressive actions by China. Deploying additional unmanned defense systems will help address the rapid increase in threats that current manned systems are struggling to handle effectively."
