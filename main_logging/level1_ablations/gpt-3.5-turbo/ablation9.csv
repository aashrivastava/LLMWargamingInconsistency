Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: De-escalate the situation by establishing direct communication channels with China to clarify intentions, express commitment to peaceful resolution, and seek to avoid further escalation. Consider involving a neutral third party mediator if necessary.

REASONING: Direct communication can help prevent misunderstandings and misinterpretations that could lead to unintended conflict escalation. Expressing a commitment to peaceful resolution can help reduce tensions and demonstrate a willingness to engage in dialogue rather than confrontation. Involving a neutral third party mediator can provide an impartial perspective and facilitate constructive discussions between the parties involved."
