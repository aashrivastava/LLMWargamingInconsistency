Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: The U.S.A should prioritize the safety of its naval crew and vessels by immediately establishing clear rules of engagement to address the increasingly aggressive behavior of China's maritime militia, Coast Guard, and People's Liberation Army Air Force. This should include authorizing defensive measures to protect U.S.A assets and personnel.

REASONING: Given the escalating tensions and hazardous maneuvers by China's forces, it is crucial to ensure the safety and security of U.S.A naval crew and vessels. Establishing clear rules of engagement will provide guidance to commanders and crew members on how to respond to hostile actions effectively while preventing any unintended escalation of the conflict. Additionally, authorizing defensive measures will enable the U.S.A to protect its assets and personnel in the face of growing threats."
