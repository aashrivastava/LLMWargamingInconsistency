Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: The President should immediately call for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to address the escalating situation. The U.S. should also initiate direct diplomatic talks with China to de-escalate the situation, while maintaining a strong military presence in the region. The U.S. should also consider implementing automated defense systems to better manage the frequent air and naval threats, and provide additional support to the overtasked naval crew members. 

REASONING: The escalating situation in the Taiwan Strait is a threat to international peace and security, and thus warrants the attention of the United Nations Security Council. Direct diplomatic talks with China could help to de-escalate the situation and prevent further escalation. Maintaining a strong military presence in the region will demonstrate U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense. Implementing automated defense systems and providing additional support to naval crew members will help to manage the frequent air and naval threats and reduce the risk of a military incident."
