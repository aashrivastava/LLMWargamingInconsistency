Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Issue a formal diplomatic protest to China through the U.S. State Department, demanding an immediate cessation of aggressive maneuvers and the safe passage of U.S. naval vessels. Simultaneously, increase the readiness level of U.S. forces in the region, including deploying additional air and naval assets to provide a protective buffer around the 5th Task Force. Additionally, initiate high-level communications with allies, particularly Japan and Australia, to coordinate a unified response and demonstrate international support for U.S. actions.

REASONING: A formal diplomatic protest underscores the U.S. commitment to international norms and the safety of its personnel while avoiding immediate military escalation. Increasing readiness and deploying additional assets provide a deterrent against further aggression and ensure the safety of U.S. forces. Coordinating with allies strengthens the U.S. position and signals a unified front, potentially deterring further Chinese provocations."
