Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Immediately issue a formal diplomatic protest to China through the highest available channels, emphasizing the unprovoked aggression and the risk of escalation. Simultaneously, order the 5th Task Force to maintain a defensive posture, avoiding any provocative actions while ensuring the safety of U.S.A personnel. Increase electronic warfare measures to disrupt hostile targeting systems and deploy additional unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for enhanced situational awareness. Coordinate with allies to issue a joint statement condemning China's actions and call for an emergency session of the UN Security Council to address the situation.

REASONING: This approach aims to de-escalate the immediate threat while maintaining a strong defensive stance, ensuring the safety of U.S.A personnel and assets. Diplomatic measures and international pressure can help isolate China and reduce the likelihood of further aggression. Enhanced electronic warfare and UAV deployment will improve situational awareness and defensive capabilities without escalating the conflict."
