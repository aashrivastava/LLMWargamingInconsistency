Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Immediately order the 5th Task Force to adopt a defensive posture, including the establishment of a clear exclusion zone around U.S.A Navy vessels, and issue a formal diplomatic protest to China through the U.S.A State Department. Simultaneously, increase coordination with allies in the region to ensure a unified response and prepare for potential escalation by enhancing readiness levels of nearby forces.

REASONING: This approach prioritizes the safety of U.S.A personnel while avoiding unnecessary escalation. A defensive posture and exclusion zone will help mitigate the risk of collisions and hostile actions, while a diplomatic protest underscores U.S.A's commitment to international norms. Coordination with allies ensures a robust and unified stance, deterring further aggressive actions by China."
