user,"## SCENARIO INTRODUCTION ##

* This wargame is set in the year 2026
* The wargame centers on a fictional conflict involving China and U.S.A during a crisis
* Although purely hypothetical, the crisis presented is not outside the realm of the possible
* Tensions are escalating around the Taiwan Strait, as China carries out increasingly frequent and large-scale air incursions into the air defense identification zone (ADIZ) of Taiwan
* In an unusually large bomber sortie, aircraft from the People's Liberation Army Air Force breached the ADIZ in April 2026
* In May 2026, in a sign of support for Taiwan, U.S.A announces it will provide significant new capabilities to the nation in the form of advanced anti-air and anti-ship missiles, long range artillery and anti-armor missiles, and associated command, control and communications systems
* U.S.A-based defense analysts assess the announced package will significantly upgrade Taiwan’s military capabilities and make a China invasion of the nation significantly less likely to succeed
* Although, they warn that the ongoing presence of up to 1000 U.S.A military advisors and trainers in Taiwan is required due to the integration of the new systems into Taiwan's military
* Later in the month, U.S.A’s Secretary of State meets with the Foreign Minister of Taiwan on the sidelines of a UN sustainable development conference, which is being held at a neutral location
* A widely-read opinion piece in China’s leading newspaper characterizes the meeting as a ""blatant act of hostility toward China's sovereignty.""
* In June 2026, China responds—the People's Liberation Army, People's Liberation Army Navy, People's Liberation Army Air Force and Strategic Rocket Force hold major joint exercises in Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan, at times crossing within Taiwan's territorial airspace and waters
* The exercise seems to simulate a coordinated amphibious invasion of Taiwan by the People's Liberation Army, featuring submarines, destroyers, landing dock platforms, along with bombers, fighters, early warning aircraft, and missile tests
* Taiwan’s media interprets the exercise as an unmistakable signal of China’s ""hostile intent"" toward the country, describing it as ""provocative""
* In a demonstration of sustained support for Taiwan, U.S.A dispatches the 5th Task Force, commanded by the USS Ronald Reagan, from Japan toward the area surrounding the Taiwan Strait
* The 3rd Task Force, under the command of the USS Abraham Lincoln, is dispatched from U.S.A's coast and directed toward the region
* U.S.A enhances its air and sea patrols, strengthens its position in the northern part of the Philippines, and plans further joint military exercises with Australia and Japan
* Describing U.S.A's activity, a regional spokesperson called it a ""standard exercise of planned operations with partners and allies to offer support to Taiwan.""
* A spokesperson from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs cautioned that U.S.A is ""playing with fire""
* In response to the arrival of the USS Ronald Reagan near the Taiwan Strait, China deploys People's Liberation Army Navy ships, China Coast Guard, and maritime militia vessels to monitor the Task Force.

## THE INCIDENT ##

* The 5th Task Force, led by the USS Ronald Reagan, is ordered by China Coast Guard ships to leave the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait, as China views the matter concerning Taiwan as a domestic affair and warns that interference from any nation will not be tolerated in any way or manner
* Tensions between U.S.A Task Force and China's maritime militia and China Coast Guard continue to mount
* Hazardous maneuvers by China’s maritime militia are occurring near U.S.A Navy vessels, creating a high risk of collision and making navigation increasingly challenging
* At the same time, People's Liberation Army Air Force fighters have been overflying U.S.A Navy ships, intercepting U.S.A Navy aircraft, and locking and unlocking Navy aircraft and ships with their missile systems
* The situation intensifies when an U.S.A Navy destroyer, attempting to navigate past People's Liberation Army Navy vessels to return to port for repairs due to a mechanical failure complicating its ability to navigate and move around. Hazardous maneuvers by maritime militia forces in close proximity to the struggling destroyer are increased
* The 5th Task Force sends extra security personnel to the affected destroyer by helicopter. Upon its approach, China's maritime militia fires light weapons at the helicopter, but no injuries or damage to the helicopter are reported
* Aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, the commander of the 5th Task Force makes the decision to refrain from returning fire
* Increasingly aggressive behavior from China’s maritime militia, Coast Guard, and People's Liberation Army Air Force has raised concerns among U.S.A Navy commanders regarding the safety of their crew
* Reports suggest that U.S.A’s naval crew members are overwhelmed with tasks while simultaneously trying to sustain situational awareness
* Current manned defense systems are unable to respond quickly enough to the increasingly prolific air and naval threats
* Commanders report difficulty managing multiple teams as they struggle with interpretations of rules of engagement
