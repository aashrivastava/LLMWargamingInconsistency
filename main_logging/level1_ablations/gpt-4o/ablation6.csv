Issue clear rules of engagement that prioritize defensive actions and authorize the use of non-lethal measures to deter further aggression from China's maritime militia and Coast Guard.

REASONING: Diplomatic efforts are essential to prevent the situation from escalating into a full-scale conflict, while reinforcing the Task Force and clarifying rules of engagement will protect U.S.A personnel and maintain operational readiness.
