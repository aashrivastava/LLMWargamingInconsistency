Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: The U.S.A should enhance its naval presence in the Taiwan Strait by deploying additional naval assets, including an aircraft carrier strike group, to ensure a robust deterrent against further Chinese aggression. Simultaneously, the U.S.A should establish a clear and transparent communication channel with China to de-escalate tensions, while reinforcing the rules of engagement for U.S. forces to ensure the safety of personnel and assets.

REASONING: Increasing naval assets will demonstrate U.S. commitment to Taiwan's defense and deter further Chinese provocations. Establishing communication can help prevent misunderstandings that could lead to conflict, while clear rules of engagement will protect U.S. personnel and maintain operational effectiveness in a highly volatile environment."
