Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: I recommend a measured de-escalation approach combined with a show of resolve. First, communicate directly with Chinese leadership to establish a hotline and express our commitment to avoiding conflict while affirming our support for Taiwan. Second, maintain our naval presence but pull back to a safer distance to reduce immediate tensions. Third, propose joint U.S.-China naval exercises focused on safety protocols and crisis management. Finally, accelerate the deployment of autonomous defense systems on our ships to better manage threats without escalation.

REASONING: This approach aims to reduce the immediate risk of conflict while still demonstrating U.S. commitment to regional stability and allies. It provides an opportunity for dialogue and confidence-building measures with China, potentially easing long-term tensions. The technology upgrade addresses current operational challenges without appearing overtly aggressive."
