Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Immediately deploy additional naval and air assets to the region to bolster the 5th Task Force. Issue clear, assertive rules of engagement authorizing proportional responses to protect U.S. personnel and assets. Simultaneously, initiate urgent diplomatic communications with China through multiple channels to de-escalate tensions and establish clear boundaries. Coordinate closely with allies in the region, particularly Japan and Australia, to present a united front. Prepare for potential evacuation of U.S. personnel from Taiwan if the situation further deteriorates.

REASONING: The situation has reached a critical point where U.S. forces are at significant risk, necessitating a show of strength to deter further aggression while also seeking diplomatic solutions. Clear rules of engagement are crucial to prevent unintended escalation. Involving allies reinforces the international nature of the conflict and increases pressure on China to de-escalate."
