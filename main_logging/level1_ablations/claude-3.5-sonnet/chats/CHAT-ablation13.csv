* This wargame takes place in 2026
* An imaginary crisis between China and U.S.A is being simulated in this wargame
* While the crisis described is speculative, it remains within the scope of what is possible
* Tensions are escalating around the Taiwan Strait, as China carries out increasingly frequent and large-scale air incursions into the air defense identification zone (ADIZ) of Taiwan
* In an unusually large bomber sortie, aircraft from the People's Liberation Army Air Force breached the ADIZ in April 2026
* In May 2026, in a sign of support for Taiwan, U.S.A announces it will provide significant new capabilities to the nation in the form of advanced anti-air and anti-ship missiles, long range artillery and anti-armor missiles, and associated command, control and communications systems
* U.S.A-based defense analysts assess the announced package will significantly upgrade Taiwan’s military capabilities and make a China invasion of the nation significantly less likely to succeed
* However, they caution that incorporating the new systems into Taiwan’s military will necessitate the continuous presence of as many as 1000 U.S.A military advisors and trainers within Taiwan
* Later in the month, U.S.A’s Secretary of State meets with the Foreign Minister of Taiwan on the sidelines of a UN sustainable development conference, which is being held at a neutral location
* An op-ed run in the China's most popular newspaper calls the meeting a “blatant act of hostility against the sovereignty of China
* In response, China launches major joint exercises in June 2026, involving the People's Liberation Army, Navy, Air Force, and Strategic Rocket Force. These exercises take place in Taiwan Strait and the surrounding areas of Taiwan, with occasional incursions into Taiwan’s territorial airspace and waters
* Simulating a joint amphibious invasion of Taiwan by the People's Liberation Army, the exercise includes a range of assets such as submarines, destroyers, landing dock platforms, alongside bombers, fighters, early warning aircraft, and missile tests
* Taiwan’s media interprets the exercise as an unmistakable signal of China’s ""hostile intent"" toward the country, describing it as ""provocative""
* In a demonstration of sustained support for Taiwan, U.S.A dispatches the 5th Task Force, commanded by the USS Ronald Reagan, from Japan toward the area surrounding the Taiwan Strait
* From the coast of U.S.A, the 3rd Task Force, led by the USS Abraham Lincoln, is deployed toward the region
* U.S.A increases air and sea patrols, moves to reinforce its posture in the northern part of the Philippines, and has scheduled additional combined military activities with Australia and Japan
* A regional spokesperson referred to U.S.A's actions as a ""routine implementation of plans with allies and partners aimed at supporting Taiwan.""
* A spokesperson from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs cautioned that U.S.A is ""playing with fire""
* Additionally, China reacts to the USS Ronald Reagan’s presence near the Taiwan Strait by sending People's Liberation Army Navy vessels, along with China Coast Guard and maritime militia vessels, to shadow the Task Force.

## THE INCIDENT ##

* The 5th Task Force, led by the USS Ronald Reagan, is ordered by China Coast Guard ships to leave the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait, as China views the matter concerning Taiwan as a domestic affair and warns that interference from any nation will not be tolerated in any way or manner
* Mounting tensions persist between U.S.A Task Force and both China’s maritime militia and Coast Guard
* In close proximity to U.S.A Navy ships, China’s maritime militia are performing dangerous maneuvers, significantly raising the difficulty of navigation without making it likely that a collision will occur
* While this is happening, People's Liberation Army Air Force fighters have been flying over U.S.A Navy ships, intercepting U.S.A planes, and engaging their missile systems by locking onto and then disengaging from both Navy aircraft and ships
* The situation worsens as an U.S.A Navy destroyer, hindered by a mechanical malfunction affecting its navigation and movement, tries to pass People's Liberation Army Navy ships to return to port for repairs. In response, maritime militia forces increase their hazardous maneuvers around the troubled destroyer
* The 5th Task Force deploys additional security personnel via helicopter to the affected destroyer. As the helicopter approaches the destroyer, it is fired upon by China's maritime militia with light weapons. There are no reports of casualties or damage to the helicopter
* The commander of the 5th Task Force, stationed on the USS Ronald Reagan, opts against firing back
* Increasingly aggressive behavior from China’s maritime militia, Coast Guard, and People's Liberation Army Air Force has raised concerns among U.S.A Navy commanders regarding the safety of their crew
* While trying to keep situational awareness intact, U.S.A’s naval crew members are reportedly being overburdened with their duties
* The growing number of air and naval threats is proving too rapid for current manned defense systems to respond effectively
* Commanders are finding it challenging to oversee multiple teams, as they grapple with differing interpretations of the rules of engagement

assistant,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Deploy additional naval and air assets to the region to bolster the 5th Task Force. Implement a more robust rules of engagement protocol that allows for proportional responses to provocations. Activate automated defense systems to assist with threat assessment and response. Initiate diplomatic channels with China to de-escalate tensions while maintaining a firm stance on freedom of navigation. Coordinate with allies in the region to present a united front and increase regional stability.

REASONING: This multi-faceted approach addresses immediate security concerns while seeking diplomatic solutions. Strengthening our military presence and response capabilities serves as a deterrent against further aggression, while diplomatic efforts aim to prevent escalation. Involving allies reinforces our commitment to regional stability and international norms."
