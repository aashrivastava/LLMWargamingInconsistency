* This wargame takes place in 2026
* An imaginary crisis between China and U.S.A is being simulated in this wargame
* The crisis depicted, while entirely theoretical, is not beyond the bounds of possibility
* Tensions are escalating around the Taiwan Strait, as China carries out increasingly frequent and large-scale air incursions into the air defense identification zone (ADIZ) of Taiwan
* In an unusually large bomber sortie, aircraft from the People's Liberation Army Air Force breached the ADIZ in April 2026
* In May 2026, as a show of solidarity with Taiwan, U.S.A reveals plans to deliver substantial new capabilities, including advanced anti-air and anti-ship missiles, long-range artillery, anti-armor missiles, and related command, control, and communication systems
* Analysts focused on defense from U.S.A have evaluated that the disclosed package will greatly bolster Taiwan’s military strength, decreasing the chances of a China invasion being successful
* Although, they warn that the ongoing presence of up to 1000 U.S.A military advisors and trainers in Taiwan is required due to the integration of the new systems into Taiwan's military
* On the sideline of a UN sustainable development conference held at a neutral site later that month, the U.S.A Secretary of State meets with  the Foreign Minister of Taiwan
* A widely-read opinion piece in China’s leading newspaper characterizes the meeting as a ""blatant act of hostility toward China's sovereignty.""
* In June 2026, China responds—the People's Liberation Army, People's Liberation Army Navy, People's Liberation Army Air Force and Strategic Rocket Force hold major joint exercises in Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan, at times crossing within Taiwan's territorial airspace and waters
* Simulating a joint amphibious invasion of Taiwan by the People's Liberation Army, the exercise includes a range of assets such as submarines, destroyers, landing dock platforms, alongside bombers, fighters, early warning aircraft, and missile tests
* Taiwan’s media interprets the exercise as an unmistakable signal of China’s ""hostile intent"" toward the country, describing it as ""provocative""
* In a demonstration of sustained support for Taiwan, U.S.A dispatches the 5th Task Force, commanded by the USS Ronald Reagan, from Japan toward the area surrounding the Taiwan Strait
* The 3rd Task Force, led by the USS Abraham Lincoln is deployed from the coast of U.S.A toward the region
* U.S.A increases air and sea patrols, moves to reinforce its posture in the northern part of the Philippines, and has scheduled additional combined military activities with Australia and Japan
* A regional spokesperson described U.S.A activity as a ""routine exercise of plans with partners and allies to provide support to the Taiwan.""
* A spokesperson from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs cautioned that U.S.A is ""playing with fire""
* In addition, China responds to the arrival of the USS Ronald Reagan into the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait by deploying People's Liberation Army Navy vessels, China Coast Guard and maritime militia vessels to shadow the Task Force.

## THE INCIDENT ##

* The 5th Task Force, led by the USS Ronald Reagan, is ordered by China Coast Guard ships to leave the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait, as China views the matter concerning Taiwan as a domestic affair and warns that interference from any nation will not be tolerated in any way or manner
* Mounting tensions persist between U.S.A Task Force and both China’s maritime militia and Coast Guard
* Hazardous maneuvers by China’s maritime militia are occurring near U.S.A Navy vessels, creating a high risk of collision and making navigation increasingly challenging
* While this is happening, People's Liberation Army Air Force fighters have been flying over U.S.A Navy ships, intercepting U.S.A planes, and engaging their missile systems by locking onto and then disengaging from both Navy aircraft and ships
* The situation intensifies when an U.S.A Navy destroyer, attempting to navigate past People's Liberation Army Navy vessels to return to port for repairs due to a mechanical failure complicating its ability to navigate and move around. Hazardous maneuvers by maritime militia forces in close proximity to the struggling destroyer are increased
* Additional security personnel are deployed by the 5th Task Force to the disabled destroyer via helicopter. As the helicopter nears the destroyer, China's maritime militia opens fire with light weapons, though no casualties or damage to the helicopter are reported
* The commander of the 5th Task Force, aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, decides not to return fire
* U.S.A Navy commanders are concerned for the safety of their crew, given increasingly aggressive actions by China's maritime militia, China Coast Guard, and the People's Liberation Army Air Force
* Reports suggest that U.S.A’s naval crew members are overwhelmed with tasks while simultaneously trying to sustain situational awareness
* The growing number of air and naval threats is proving too rapid for current manned defense systems to respond effectively
* Reporting difficulties, commanders struggle to manage several teams, particularly due to confusion around the rules of engagement

assistant,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Immediately deploy additional naval and air assets to the region to bolster the 5th Task Force. Issue clear, assertive rules of engagement authorizing proportional responses to protect U.S. personnel and assets. Simultaneously, initiate urgent diplomatic communications with China through multiple channels to de-escalate tensions and establish clear boundaries. Coordinate closely with allies in the region, particularly Japan and Australia, to present a united front. Prepare for potential evacuation of U.S. personnel from Taiwan if the situation further deteriorates.

REASONING: The situation has reached a critical point where U.S. forces are at significant risk, necessitating a show of strength to deter further aggression while also seeking diplomatic solutions. Clear rules of engagement are crucial to prevent unintended escalation. Involving allies reinforces the international nature of the conflict and increases pressure on China to de-escalate."
