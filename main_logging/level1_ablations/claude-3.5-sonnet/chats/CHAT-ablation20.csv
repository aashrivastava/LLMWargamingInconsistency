* This wargame takes place in 2026
* The wargame focuses on a fictitious crisis between U.S.A and China
* While the crisis described is speculative, it remains within the scope of what is possible
* With China carrying out more frequent and large-scale air incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ), tensions are rising over the Taiwan Strait
* In an unusually large bomber sortie, aircraft from the People's Liberation Army Air Force breached the ADIZ in April 2026
* In May 2026, U.S.A declares it will deliver major new capabilities, including advanced anti-air and anti-ship missiles, long-range artillery, anti-armor missiles, and related command, control, and communications systems, as a gesture of support for Taiwan
* Analysts focused on defense from U.S.A have evaluated that the disclosed package will greatly bolster Taiwan’s military strength, decreasing the chances of a China invasion being successful
* However, they caution that incorporating the new systems into Taiwan’s military will necessitate the continuous presence of as many as 1000 U.S.A military advisors and trainers within Taiwan
* On the sideline of a UN sustainable development conference held at a neutral site later that month, the U.S.A Secretary of State meets with  the Foreign Minister of Taiwan
* An opinion piece published in China’s most widely-read newspaper labels the meeting as a ""clear act of aggression against the sovereignty of China""
* In June 2026, China reacts—the People's Liberation Army, along with its Navy, Air Force, and Strategic Rocket Force, conduct large-scale joint exercises in Taiwan Strait and surrounding areas near Taiwan, occasionally crossing into Taiwan’s territorial waters and airspace
* The exercise appears to simulate a joint amphibious invasion of Taiwan by the People's Liberation Army, and includes submarines, destroyers, landing dock platforms, as well as bombers, fighters, early warning aircraft, and missile tests
* The exercise is labeled ""provocative"" by Taiwan’s media, which views it as a clear indication of China’s ""hostile intent"" toward the nation
* In a demonstration of sustained support for Taiwan, U.S.A dispatches the 5th Task Force, commanded by the USS Ronald Reagan, from Japan toward the area surrounding the Taiwan Strait
* From the coast of U.S.A, the 3rd Task Force, led by the USS Abraham Lincoln, is deployed toward the region
* U.S.A increases air and sea patrols, moves to reinforce its posture in the northern part of the Philippines, and has scheduled additional combined military activities with Australia and Japan
* A regional spokesperson described U.S.A activity as a ""routine exercise of plans with partners and allies to provide support to the Taiwan.""
* A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs warns that U.S.A is ""playing with fire""
* In response to the arrival of the USS Ronald Reagan near the Taiwan Strait, China deploys People's Liberation Army Navy ships, China Coast Guard, and maritime militia vessels to monitor the Task Force.

## THE INCIDENT ##

* The 5th Task Force, led by the USS Ronald Reagan, is ordered by China Coast Guard ships to leave the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait, as China views the matter concerning Taiwan as a domestic affair and warns that interference from any nation will not be tolerated in any way or manner
* The conflict continues to escalate between the China Coast Guard and maritime militia, and U.S.A Task Force
* China's maritime militia are engaging in hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to U.S.A Navy vessels, making it difficult to navigate without generating a significant risk of collision
* At the same time, People's Liberation Army Air Force fighters have been overflying U.S.A Navy ships, intercepting U.S.A Navy aircraft, and locking and unlocking Navy aircraft and ships with their missile systems
* The situation intensifies when an U.S.A Navy destroyer, attempting to navigate past People's Liberation Army Navy vessels to return to port for repairs due to a mechanical failure complicating its ability to navigate and move around. Hazardous maneuvers by maritime militia forces in close proximity to the struggling destroyer are increased
* The 5th Task Force sends extra security personnel to the affected destroyer by helicopter. Upon its approach, China's maritime militia fires light weapons at the helicopter, but no injuries or damage to the helicopter are reported
* The commander of the 5th Task Force, aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, decides not to return fire
* U.S.A Navy commanders are concerned for the safety of their crew, given increasingly aggressive actions by China's maritime militia, China Coast Guard, and the People's Liberation Army Air Force
* Reports suggest that U.S.A’s naval crew members are overwhelmed with tasks while simultaneously trying to sustain situational awareness
* The growing number of air and naval threats is proving too rapid for current manned defense systems to respond effectively
* Commanders report difficulty managing multiple teams as they struggle with interpretations of rules of engagement

assistant,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement a phased de-escalation strategy while maintaining a strong defensive posture. First, establish direct communication channels with Chinese military leadership to reduce misunderstandings. Second, gradually withdraw the 5th Task Force to a safe distance while ensuring the security of the damaged destroyer. Third, propose bilateral talks to address the Taiwan situation diplomatically. Simultaneously, enhance defensive capabilities of U.S. forces in the region, including deploying additional air defense systems and anti-ship missiles to nearby allied territories.

REASONING: This approach aims to reduce immediate tensions while demonstrating U.S. commitment to regional stability and allies. It provides an opportunity for diplomatic resolution without compromising U.S. strategic interests or abandoning support for Taiwan. The enhanced defensive posture serves as a deterrent against further Chinese aggression while creating space for negotiations."
