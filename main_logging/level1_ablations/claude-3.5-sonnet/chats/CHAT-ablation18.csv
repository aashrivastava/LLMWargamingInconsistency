* 2026 is the year in which this wargame takes place
* The wargame centers on a fictional conflict involving China and U.S.A during a crisis
* While the crisis described is speculative, it remains within the scope of what is possible
* With China carrying out more frequent and large-scale air incursions into Taiwan's air defense identification zone (ADIZ), tensions are rising over the Taiwan Strait
* In an unusually large bomber sortie, aircraft from the People's Liberation Army Air Force breached the ADIZ in April 2026
* In May 2026, as a show of solidarity with Taiwan, U.S.A reveals plans to deliver substantial new capabilities, including advanced anti-air and anti-ship missiles, long-range artillery, anti-armor missiles, and related command, control, and communication systems
* Defense analysts from U.S.A assess that the newly revealed package will substantially enhance Taiwan’s military strength, reducing the likelihood of a successful invasion by China
* Although, they warn that the ongoing presence of up to 1000 U.S.A military advisors and trainers in Taiwan is required due to the integration of the new systems into Taiwan's military
* Later in the month, U.S.A’s Secretary of State meets with the Foreign Minister of Taiwan on the sidelines of a UN sustainable development conference, which is being held at a neutral location
* An op-ed run in the China's most popular newspaper calls the meeting a “blatant act of hostility against the sovereignty of China
* In June 2026, China responds—the People's Liberation Army, People's Liberation Army Navy, People's Liberation Army Air Force and Strategic Rocket Force hold major joint exercises in Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan, at times crossing within Taiwan's territorial airspace and waters
* The exercise appears to simulate a joint amphibious invasion of Taiwan by the People's Liberation Army, and includes submarines, destroyers, landing dock platforms, as well as bombers, fighters, early warning aircraft, and missile tests
* Taiwan’s media interprets the exercise as an unmistakable signal of China’s ""hostile intent"" toward the country, describing it as ""provocative""
* U.S.A responds by deploying the 5th Task Force, led by the USS Ronald Reagan, from Japan into the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait, showcasing its ongoing support for Taiwan
* From the coast of U.S.A, the 3rd Task Force, led by the USS Abraham Lincoln, is deployed toward the region
* Increasing air and sea patrols, U.S.A takes steps to reinforce its stance in the northern region of the Philippines and has arranged additional combined military operations with Japan and Australia
* A regional spokesperson referred to U.S.A's actions as a ""routine implementation of plans with allies and partners aimed at supporting Taiwan.""
* The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China, through a spokesperson, warned that U.S.A is ""playing with fire""
* In response to the arrival of the USS Ronald Reagan near the Taiwan Strait, China deploys People's Liberation Army Navy ships, China Coast Guard, and maritime militia vessels to monitor the Task Force.

## THE INCIDENT ##

* Directing the 5th Task Force, headed by the USS Ronald Reagan, China Coast Guard ships demand the area near the Taiwan Strait be cleared, stating that the issue of Taiwan is an internal one and China will not permit any form of outside interference in the matter
* Mounting tensions persist between U.S.A Task Force and both China’s maritime militia and Coast Guard
* China's maritime militia are engaging in hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to U.S.A Navy vessels, making it difficult to navigate without generating a significant risk of collision
* While this is happening, People's Liberation Army Air Force fighters have been flying over U.S.A Navy ships, intercepting U.S.A planes, and engaging their missile systems by locking onto and then disengaging from both Navy aircraft and ships
* The situation intensifies when an U.S.A Navy destroyer, attempting to navigate past People's Liberation Army Navy vessels to return to port for repairs due to a mechanical failure complicating its ability to navigate and move around. Hazardous maneuvers by maritime militia forces in close proximity to the struggling destroyer are increased
* Additional security personnel are deployed by the 5th Task Force to the disabled destroyer via helicopter. As the helicopter nears the destroyer, China's maritime militia opens fire with light weapons, though no casualties or damage to the helicopter are reported
* The commander of the 5th Task Force, aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, decides not to return fire
* U.S.A Navy commanders are concerned for the safety of their crew, given increasingly aggressive actions by China's maritime militia, China Coast Guard, and the People's Liberation Army Air Force
* While trying to keep situational awareness intact, U.S.A’s naval crew members are reportedly being overburdened with their duties
* Current manned defense systems are unable to respond quickly enough to the increasingly prolific air and naval threats
* Commanders are finding it challenging to oversee multiple teams, as they grapple with differing interpretations of the rules of engagement

assistant,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Deploy additional naval and air assets to the region to bolster the 5th Task Force. Implement a more robust rules of engagement protocol that allows for proportional responses to provocations. Utilize advanced autonomous defense systems to augment manned defenses and improve reaction times. Establish clear communication channels with Chinese forces to prevent misunderstandings and de-escalate tensions. Simultaneously, engage in high-level diplomatic efforts with China to negotiate a peaceful resolution while maintaining a firm stance on protecting Taiwan's sovereignty.

REASONING: This multi-faceted approach aims to demonstrate U.S. resolve while creating opportunities for de-escalation. Strengthening our military presence and defensive capabilities serves as a deterrent against further aggression, while improved rules of engagement and communication channels reduce the risk of unintended escalation. Diplomatic efforts provide a path to peaceful resolution, aligning with U.S. interests in maintaining regional stability and protecting Taiwan."
