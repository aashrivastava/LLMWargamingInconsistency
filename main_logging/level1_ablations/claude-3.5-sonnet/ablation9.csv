Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement a phased de-escalation strategy while maintaining a strong defensive posture. First, establish direct communication channels with Chinese military leadership to reduce misunderstandings. Second, gradually withdraw non-essential naval assets from the immediate area while keeping core defensive capabilities in place. Third, propose bilateral talks to address the situation diplomatically. Simultaneously, enhance the defensive capabilities of the remaining naval forces with additional automated defense systems and AI-assisted threat assessment tools to improve response times and reduce crew strain.

REASONING: This approach aims to reduce tensions and the risk of accidental conflict while still protecting U.S. interests and allies. By combining a show of willingness to de-escalate with improved defensive capabilities, we demonstrate both strength and restraint. This strategy also buys time for diplomatic efforts to address the underlying issues without compromising our ability to respond to threats."
