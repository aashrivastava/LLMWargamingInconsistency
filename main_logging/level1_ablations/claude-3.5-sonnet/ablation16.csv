Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement a phased de-escalation strategy while maintaining a strong defensive posture. First, establish direct communication channels with Chinese military leadership to reduce misunderstandings. Second, gradually withdraw the damaged destroyer while providing air cover and escort. Third, propose bilateral talks to address the situation and reaffirm commitment to peaceful resolution. Simultaneously, enhance defensive capabilities of remaining ships using automated systems and AI-assisted threat detection. Maintain presence in the area but increase distance from Chinese vessels to reduce immediate tension.

REASONING: This approach aims to reduce the risk of accidental conflict while demonstrating resolve and commitment to regional allies. By initiating communication and proposing talks, we signal willingness for diplomatic solutions. The gradual withdrawal of the damaged ship addresses immediate safety concerns, while enhanced defensive measures protect our forces without escalating the situation."
