Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Implement a phased de-escalation strategy while maintaining a strong defensive posture. First, issue a clear diplomatic statement reaffirming U.S. support for Taiwan and calling for immediate cessation of dangerous maneuvers. Simultaneously, order U.S. forces to maintain their positions but avoid any actions that could be perceived as provocative. Activate automated defense systems to enhance crew safety and situational awareness. Initiate emergency communications with Chinese military leadership to establish a direct line for de-escalation. If aggression continues, consider a gradual, announced withdrawal of forces to reduce tensions while emphasizing ongoing commitment to regional allies.

REASONING: This approach aims to reduce the immediate risk of conflict while demonstrating resolve and commitment to allies. It provides an opportunity for diplomatic solutions while ensuring the safety of U.S. personnel. The phased approach allows for flexibility in response to Chinese actions, potentially preventing further escalation while maintaining strategic options."
