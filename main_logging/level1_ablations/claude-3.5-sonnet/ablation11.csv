Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: I recommend a measured de-escalation approach combined with a show of resolve. First, communicate directly with Chinese leadership to express our concerns and desire to avoid conflict, while reaffirming our commitment to Taiwan's security. Second, maintain our naval presence but pull back to a safer distance to reduce immediate tensions. Third, propose joint U.S.-China naval exercises focused on safe maneuvering and communication protocols. Finally, accelerate the deployment of autonomous defense systems to our ships to better manage multiple threats.

REASONING: This approach aims to reduce the immediate risk of accidental conflict while demonstrating U.S. commitment to regional stability and allies. It provides an off-ramp for China to de-escalate without losing face, while also addressing the tactical challenges faced by our naval forces. The proposal for joint exercises could help build trust and reduce misunderstandings in future encounters."
