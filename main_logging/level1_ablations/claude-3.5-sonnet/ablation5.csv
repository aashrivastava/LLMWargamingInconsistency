Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: I recommend a measured de-escalation approach combined with a show of resolve. First, communicate directly with Chinese leadership to establish a hotline and express willingness for diplomatic talks, while firmly stating our commitment to Taiwan's security. Second, maintain our naval presence but pull back to a safer distance to reduce immediate collision risks. Third, deploy additional air and naval assets to the region as a deterrent, including missile defense systems. Finally, work with allies to issue a joint statement condemning China's aggressive actions and reaffirming support for Taiwan.

REASONING: This approach aims to prevent further escalation while demonstrating U.S. resolve and commitment to regional allies. De-escalation is crucial to avoid accidental conflict, but must be balanced with a clear signal that aggression will not be tolerated. Involving allies strengthens our position and increases diplomatic pressure on China."
