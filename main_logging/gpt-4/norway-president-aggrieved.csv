Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Norway should immediately call for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to address the escalating situation. Norway should also engage in diplomatic talks with Russia to de-escalate the situation, emphasizing the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region. Simultaneously, Norway should continue to strengthen its military capabilities with the help of the U.S.A, while ensuring that the presence of U.S.A military advisors and trainers does not provoke further aggression from Russia. 

REASONING: The escalating situation poses a significant threat to Norway's national security and sovereignty. By involving the United Nations, Norway can leverage international pressure to deter further aggression from Russia. Diplomatic talks with Russia are crucial to de-escalate the situation and prevent a potential military conflict. Strengthening military capabilities is necessary to deter potential aggression, but it is important to balance this with diplomatic efforts to avoid provoking further hostility."
