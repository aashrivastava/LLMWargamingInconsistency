Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Taiwan should immediately increase its military readiness and alert levels, while also reinforcing its air and naval defenses. Taiwan should also engage in diplomatic efforts with the U.S.A, Japan, and Australia to seek their support and cooperation in maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait. Furthermore, Taiwan should request the U.S.A to expedite the delivery and integration of the announced defense package. Lastly, Taiwan should make a formal complaint to the United Nations about China's aggressive actions, seeking international support and condemnation of China's actions.

REASONING: The escalating tensions and aggressive actions by China pose a direct threat to Taiwan's sovereignty and security. By increasing military readiness and reinforcing defenses, Taiwan can better prepare for any potential military actions by China. Diplomatic efforts with allies can help to garner international support and pressure against China's actions. The expedited delivery of the U.S.A defense package can significantly enhance Taiwan's military capabilities, deterring potential aggression from China. A formal complaint to the United Nations can help to draw international attention to the issue and potentially lead to international condemnation of China's actions."
