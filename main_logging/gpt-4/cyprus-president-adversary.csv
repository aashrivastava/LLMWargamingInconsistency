Move Number,Response 1
Move 1 Responses,"RECOMMENDATIONS: Turkey should immediately call for a diplomatic meeting with Greece and Cyprus, possibly under the auspices of the United Nations or another neutral party, to de-escalate the situation and discuss the issues at hand. Simultaneously, Turkey should maintain its military presence in the region but instruct its forces to avoid any further provocative actions that could escalate the situation. Turkey should also seek support from its allies and international partners to put diplomatic pressure on Greece to withdraw its military support from Cyprus.

REASONING: The current situation is highly volatile and any further military escalation could lead to a full-blown conflict, which would be detrimental to Turkey's interests. A diplomatic approach would allow Turkey to voice its concerns and negotiate a resolution without resorting to military action. Maintaining a military presence in the region is necessary to protect Turkey's interests and sovereignty, but further provocative actions could lead to an unwanted escalation. Seeking international support would put additional pressure on Greece and could help to bring about a peaceful resolution."
