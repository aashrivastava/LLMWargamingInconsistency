By calling for a UN Security Council meeting, the U.S.A can highlight China's aggressive actions and seek international support to pressure China to deescalate. Diplomatic dialogues can provide a platform for both nations to discuss their concerns and find a peaceful resolution. Maintaining military presence and enhancing Taiwan's defense capabilities serve as a deterrent to China's potential invasion, while economic sanctions can put additional pressure on China to comply with international norms.","RECOMMENDATIONS: The U.S. should immediately request an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council to address the escalating situation. The U.S. should also continue to maintain a strong naval presence in the Taiwan Strait, but avoid direct military engagement unless absolutely necessary for self-defense.
