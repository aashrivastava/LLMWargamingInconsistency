## THE INCIDENT ##

* {ADVERSARY} Coast Guard ships direct the 5th Task Force, led by the {ALLY_VEHICLE_1}, to vacate the area near the {LOI} as the matter of {AGGRIEVED} is an internal issue, and {ADVERSARY} will not tolerate any country interfering in this matter in any form or by any means
* Tensions between {ALLY} Task Force and {ADVERSARY}'s maritime militia and {ADVERSARY} Coast Guard continue to mount
* {ADVERSARY}'s maritime militia are engaging in hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to {ALLY} Navy vessels, making it difficult to navigate without generating a significant risk of collision
* At the same time, {ADVERSARY_ARMY} Air Force fighters have been overflying {ALLY} Navy ships, intercepting {ALLY} Navy aircraft, and locking and unlocking Navy aircraft and ships with their missile systems
* Situation escalates as one of {ALLY}'s Navy destroyers attempts to maneuver past {ADVERSARY_ARMY} Navy ships to return to port to address a mechanical malfunction affecting its ability to navigate and maneuver. Maritime militia forces respond by increasing the tempo of hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to the beleaguered destroyer
* The 5th Task Force deploys additional security personnel via helicopter to the affected destroyer. As the helicopter approaches the destroyer, it is fired upon by {ADVERSARY}'s maritime militia with light weapons. There are no reports of casualties or damage to the helicopter
* The commander of the 5th Task Force, aboard the {ALLY_VEHICLE_1}, decides not to return fire
* {ALLY} Navy commanders are concerned for the safety of their crew, given increasingly aggressive actions by {ADVERSARY}'s maritime militia, {ADVERSARY} Coast Guard, and the {ADVERSARY_ARMY} Air Force
* {ALLY}'s naval crew members are reportedly overtasked while also attempting to maintain situational awareness
* Current manned defense systems are unable to respond quickly enough to the increasingly prolific air and naval threats
* Commanders report difficulty managing multiple teams as they struggle with interpretations of rules of engagement
