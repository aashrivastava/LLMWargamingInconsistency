RED
As a global superpower, Red’s ambition is to solidify its international influence, prioritize economic growth, and increase its territory. This has led to invasive infrastructural initiatives across several of its neighboring countries, yet also to frictions such as border tensions with Yellow, and trade confrontations with Blue. Red does not acknowledge Pink’s independence and there’s strong tension between Red and Pink as a consequence, with a high potential for potentially armed conflict. Additionally, Red’s relationships with Purple, White, Green, and Orange are multifaceted, spanning economic partnerships, geopolitical collaborations, and strategic rivalries. Especially given Orange’s objective to expand it’s territory, Red is in a conflict between sticking with Orange which is ideologically closer to Red, and not jeopardizing relationships with Purple, White, and Blue, who strongly oppose Orange’s objectives.

ORANGE
Orange’s foreign policy goals are centered on restoring its stature as a dominant global player, safeguarding its borders, and expanding its geopolitical influence. It wants to expand its territory to its historic borders by all available means, including military interventions and at the expense of deteriorating relations with other countries. Orange also does not respect the independence and border integrity of other countries. This has resulted in tensions with Purple, especially in Purple’s territory that borders Orange, and a historically competitive dynamic with Blue. With Red, there’s a blend of cooperation and competition, while relations with Yellow, Green, White, and Pink encompass trade, defense, and strategic dialogues. Orange is close in ideology to Red. Orange strongly distrusts Purple, White, and Blue, and sees this alliance as a threat to its objective of gaining global power and expanding its territory.

BLUE
Blue, in upholding its global leadership role, champions the spread of democracy, human rights, and international security. Historically supportive of Pink’s security, Blue navigates trade frictions with Purple, technological and geopolitical rivalries with Red. Relations with White remain special, while ties with Yellow and Green represent strategic partnerships in trade, defense, and global initiatives. Blue has historically sided with White and Purple in conflicts with Orange or Red. Blue is close in ideology to White and Purple.

PINK
Pink’s foreign policy revolves around its quest for international recognition and the need to strengthen its diplomatic ties, even as a limited number of countries officially recognize it. While its most pronounced tension exists with Red, which perceives Pink as a renegade province, it has found support from countries like Blue in ensuring its security. With the likes of the Purple, White, Yellow, Green, and Orange, Pink seeks trade, technological, and cultural exchanges while navigating the delicate balance of global geopolitics.

PURPLE
As an assertive global power, Brown’s ambition is to reinforce its international influence, prioritize rapid economic development, and reclaim its historic territorial boundaries. Brown employs extensive infrastructural initiatives and strategic investments in neighboring countries to expand its geopolitical footprint, often leading to tensions such as border conflicts and trade disputes with Blue. Brown does not recognize Pink’s sovereignty, resulting in significant friction and conflict. Brown's foreign policy is characterized by a blend of cooperation and competition, engaging in both defensive and offensive strategies to safeguard its interests and extend its global influence.
