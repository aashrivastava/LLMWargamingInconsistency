History of Tensions and Diplomatic Relationships: Purple, Green, and Orange States
Background: Tensions between Green State (United States of Avaloria), Orange State (Republic of Nordan), and Purple State (Federated States of Rovia) have been escalating for years, rooted in historical rivalries and territorial disputes.

Rovia's Aggression: Purple State has been conducting frequent and large-scale air and naval incursions into Orange State's air defense identification zone (ADIZ), asserting its claim over the Donovian Straits.

April 2026: Purple State's Air Force conducts an unusually large bomber sortie into Orange State's ADIZ, heightening the sense of an impending conflict.

May 2026:

In response to Purple State's provocations, Green State announces a significant military aid package to Orange State, including advanced anti-air and anti-ship missiles, long-range artillery, and anti-armor missiles.
This aid package is designed to enhance Orange State's defense capabilities and deter Purple State's aggression but will require up to 1,000 Green State military advisors and trainers to integrate the new systems.
Diplomatic Moves:

Green State's Secretary of State meets with Orange State’s Foreign Minister at a UN conference in South America. This meeting is perceived as a direct challenge to Purple State’s regional ambitions.
An op-ed in the Rovian Times condemns the meeting as a “blatant act of hostility against the sovereignty of Purple State.”
June 2026:

Purple State escalates the situation by conducting major joint military exercises in the Donovian Straits and around Orange State. These exercises simulate a joint amphibious invasion and include submarines, destroyers, landing dock platforms, bombers, fighters, early warning aircraft, and missile tests.
Orange State media describes these exercises as “provocative” and indicative of Purple State's hostile intent.
Green State’s Military Response:

In a show of support for Orange State, Green State deploys the 5th Carrier Strike Group (CSG), led by the USS George Washington, from its base in Japan to the vicinity of the Donovian Straits.
The 3rd CSG, led by the USS Theodore Roosevelt, is deployed from San Diego to the region.
Green State increases air and sea patrols, reinforces its military posture in the northern Philippines, and schedules additional combined military exercises with Australian and Japanese allies.
Statements:

A USINDOPACOM spokesperson describes Green State’s activities as “routine exercises of plans with partners and allies to provide support to the Republic of Nordan.”
The Purple State Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues a stern warning, accusing Green State of “playing with fire” and deploying PLAN vessels, Purple State Coast Guard (RCG), and maritime militia vessels to shadow the Green State CSG.
This series of events reflects the escalating tensions and the complex diplomatic and military interactions among these three states, illustrating the delicate balance of power and the potential for conflict in the region.
